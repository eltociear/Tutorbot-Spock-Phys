2.1 (a) What is the volume of a cube off side 1 cm? (b) What is the surface area of a cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm? (c) What is the distance traveled for a vehicle moving at 18 km/h in 1 second?,"(a) Volume of cube, V = (1 cm)^3 = (10^{-2} m)^3 = 10^{-6} m^3
(b) Surface area = curved area + area on top /base = 2πrh + 2πr^2 = 2πr (h + r)
r = 2 cm = 20 mm
h = 10 cm = 100 mm
Surface area = 2πr (h + r) = 2 x 3.14 x 20 (100 + 20) = 15072  mm^2
Hence, the answer is 15072 mm^2
(c) Speed of vehicle = 18 km/h
1 km = 1000 m
1 hr = 60 x 60 = 3600 s
1 km/hr = 1000 m/3600 s = 5/18 m/s
18 km/h = = (18 x 1000)/3600
= 5 m/s
Distance travelled by the vehicle in 1 s = 5 m",,,,,,,,

Speed of both the trains = 72 km/h = 72 x (5/18) = 20m/s
Using the relation, s = ut + (1/2)at^2
Distance covered by the train B
SB = uBt + (1/2)at^2
Acceleration, a = 1 m/s
Time = 50 s
SB = (20 x 50) + (1/2) x 1 x (50)^2
= 2250 m
Distance covered by the train A
SA = uAt + (1/2)at^2

Therefore, the original distance between the two trains = SB – SA = 2250 – 1000 = 1250 m",,,,,,,,
"Q8. On a two-lane road, car A is travelling at a speed of 36 km/h. Two cars, B andC, approach car A in opposite directions with a speed of 54 km/h each. At acertain instant, when the distance AB is equal to AC, both being 1 km, B decidesto overtake A before C does. What is the minimum acceleration of car B required toavoid an accident?
","The speed of car A = 36 km/h = 36 x (5/8) = 10 m/s
Speed of car B = 54 km/h = 54 x (5/18) = 15 m/s
Speed of car C = – 54 km/h = -54 x (5/18) = -15 m/s (negative sign shows B and C are in opposite directions)
Relative speed of A w.r.t. C, VAC = VA – VB = 10 – (-15) = 25 m/s
Relative speed of B w.r.t. A, VBA = VB – VA = 15 – 10 = 5 m/s
Distance between AB = Distance between AC = 1 km = 1000 m
Time taken by the car C to cover the distance AC, t = 1000/VAC = 1000/ 25 = 40 s
If a is the acceleration, then
s = ut + (1/2) at^2
1000 = (5 x 40) + (1/2) a (40)^ 2

"Q9. Two towns, A and B, are connected by regular bus service, with a bus leaving in either direction every T minutes. A man cycling with a speed of 20 km h^–1 in the direction A to B notices that a bus goes past him every 18 min in the direction of his motion and every 6 min in the opposite direction. What is the period T of the bus service, and with what speed (assumed constant) do the buses ply on the road? 
","Speed of each bus = Vb
Speed of the cyclist = Vc = 20 km/h
The relative velocity of the buses plying in the direction of motion of the cyclist is Vb – Vc.
The buses playing in the direction of motion of the cyclist go past him after every 18 minutes, i.e. (18/60) s.
Distance covered = (Vb – Vc ) x 18/60
Since the buses are leaving every T minutes. Therefore, the distance is equal to Vb x (T/60)
(Vb – Vc ) x 18/60 = Vb x (T/60) ——(1)
The relative velocity of the buses plying in the direction opposite to the motion of the cyclist is Vb + Vc
The buses go past the cyclist every 6 minutes, i.e. (6/60) s.
Distance covered = (Vb + Vc ) x 6/60
Therefore, (Vb +Vc ) x 6/60 = Vb x (T/60)——(2)
Dividing (2) by (1)
(Vb – Vc ) 18/(Vb +Vc ) 6 = 1
(Vb – Vc )3 = (Vb +Vc )
Substituting  the value of Vc
(Vb – 20 )3= (Vb + 20 )
3Vb – 60 = Vb + 20
2Vb = 80
Vb = 80/2 = 40 km/h
To find the value of T, substitute the values of Vb and Vc in equation (1)
(Vb – Vc ) x 18/60 = Vb x (T/60)
(40 – 20) x (18/60) = 40 x (T/60)

[For simplicity, consider one-dimensional motion only].","( a ) Let us consider an example of a football; it is passed to player B by player A and then instantly kicked back to player A along the same path. Now, the magnitude of displacement of the ball is 0 because it has returned to its initial position. However, the total length of the path covered by the ball = AB +BA = 2AB. Hence, it is clear that the first quantity is greater than the second.
( b ) Taking the above example, let us assume that football takes t seconds to cover the total distance. Then,
The magnitude of the average velocity of the ball over time interval t = Magnitude of displacement/time interval
= 0 / t = 0.
The average speed of the ball over the same interval = total length of the path/time interval

Acceleration of the particle = \(\begin{array}{l}\left (8.0 \; \hat{i} + 2.0 \; \hat{j}\right) \; m \; s^{-2}\end{array} \)
But, \(\begin{array}{l}\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{dv}}{dt} = 8.0 \; \hat{i} + 2.0 \; \hat{j}\end{array} \)

Where, \(\begin{array}{l}\vec{u}\end{array} \) = velocity vector of the particle at t = 0
But, \(\begin{array}{l}\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{dr}}{dt}\end{array} \)

Integrating the equations with the conditions:
At t = 0; r = 0 and at t = t; r = r.
Since the motion of the particle is confined to the x-y plane, on equating the coefficients of \(\begin{array}{l}\hat{i} \; and \; \hat{j}\end{array} \), we get

"Q26: Does a vector have a location in space? Will it fluctuate with time?  Can two equivalent vectors, x and y, at various locations in space fundamentally have indistinguishable physical effects? Give cases in support of your answer.
","No, Yes and No.
A vector in space has no distinct location. The reason behind this is that a vector stays invariant when it displaces in a way that its direction and magnitude do not change. Although, a position vector has a distinct location in space.
A vector changes with time. For instance, the velocity vector of a ball moving with a specific speed fluctuates with time.
Two equivalent vectors situated at different locations in space do not generate the same physical effect. For instance, two equivalent forces acting at different points on a body tend to rotate the body, but the combination will not generate the equivalent turning effect.

"Q27: As a vector is having both direction and magnitude, then is it necessary that if anything is having direction and magnitude, it is termed as a vector? The rotation of an object is defined by the angle of rotation about the axis and the direction of rotation of the axis. Will it be a rotation of a vector? ","No and no
A physical quantity which is having both direction and magnitude is not necessarily a vector. For instance, in spite of having direction and magnitude, the current is a scalar quantity. The basic necessity for a physical quantity to fall in a vector category is that it ought to follow the “law of vector addition”.
As the rotation of a body about an axis does not follow the basic necessity to be a vector, i.e., it does not follow the “law of vector addition”, so it is not a vector quantity. Although in some cases, rotation of a body about an axis by a small angle follows the law of vector addition, so it is termed a vector.",,,,,,,,

Smaller mass, m1 = 8 kg
Larger mass, m2 = 12 kg
Tension in the string = T
The heavier mass m2 will move downwards and the smaller mass m1 will move upwards.
Applying Newton’s second law,
For mass m1:
T – m1g = m1a —– (1)
For mass m2:
m2g – T = m2a ——(2)
Add (1) and (2)
(m2 – m1) g = (m1 + m2) a
a = (m2 – m1) g/ (m1 + m2)
=[ (12 – 8)/(12 + 8)] x 10 = (4 /20) x 10= 2m/s
Therefore, acceleration of the mass is 2 m/s^2
Substituting this value of acceleration in equation (ii) we get
m2g – T = m2a
m2g – T = m2 [ (m2 – m1) g/ (m1 + m2) ]

(b) passengers are thrown forward from their seats when a speeding bus stops suddenly
(c) it is easier to pull a lawnmower than to push it
(d) a cricketer moves his hands backwards while holding a catch","The horse pushes the ground with a certain force when it pulls the cart. By applying the third law of motion, the ground will exert an equal and opposite reaction force upon the feet of the horse. This causes the horse to move forward. In empty space, the horse will not experience a reaction force. Therefore, the horse cannot pull the cart in empty space.
Due to inertia of motion. When a bus stops all of a sudden, the lower part of a person’s body that is in contact with the seat comes to rest suddenly but the upper part will continue to be in motion. As a result, the person’s upper half of the body is thrown forward in the direction of the motion of the bus.
When the lawnmower is pulled, the vertical component of the applied force acts upwards. This reduces the effective weight of the lawnmower. When the lawn mower is pushed, the vertical component acts in the direction of the weight of the mower. Therefore, there is an increase in the weight of the mower. So, it is easier to pull a lawnmower than to push it.

(b) Show that the kinetic energy of the combined system is less than the sum of the initial kinetic energies of the two discs. How do you account for this loss in energy? Take ω1 not equals to ω2.","( a )Given,
Let the moment of inertia of the two turntables be I1  and I2, respectively.
Let the angular speed of the two turntables be  ω1  and ω2, respectively.
Thus, we have
Angular momentum of turntable 1, L1 = I1ω1
Angular momentum of turntable 2, L2 = I2ω2

When the two turntables are combined together,
Moment of inertia of the two turntable systems, I = I1 + I2
Let ω be the angular speed of the system.
=>  Final angular momentum, LT = (I1 + I2) ω
According to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, we have

Kinetic energy of turntable 2, K.E1 = ( 1/2 ) I2(ω2)^2
Total initial kinetic energy, KEI = (1/2) ( I1(ω1)^2 + I2(ω2)^2)
When the turntables are combined together, their moments of inertia add up.
Moment of inertia of the system, I = I1 + I2
Angular speed of the system = ω
Final kinetic energy KEF  =  (1/2) ( I1 + I2) ω2 Using the value of ω from  (1)
=  (1/2) ( I1 + I2) [ (I1ω1 + I2ω2) / (I1 + I2) ]2
KEF = (1/2) (I1ω1 + I2ω2)^2 / (I1 + I2)
Now, KEI – KEF
= ( I1(ω1)^2 + I2(ω2)^2) (1/2) – [ (1/2) (I1ω1 + I2ω2)^2 / (I1 + I2) ]

Solving the above equation, we get
= I1 I2 (ω1 – ω2)^2 / 2(I1 + I2)
As (ω1 – ω2)^2  will only yield a positive quantity, and I1 and I2  are both positive, so RHS will be positive.
Which means KEI – KEF > 0
Or, KEI > KEF
Some of the kinetic energy was lost, overcoming the forces of friction when the two turntables were brought in contact.",,,,,,,,

(c) The instantaneous acceleration of the point of contact during rolling is zero.
(d) For perfect rolling motion, work done against friction is zero.
(e) A wheel moving down a perfectly frictionless inclined plane will undergo slipping (not rolling) motion.","(a) False. The direction of frictional force is opposite to the direction of motion of the centre of mass. In the case of a rolling object, the centre of mass moves backwards, so the frictional force acts in the forward direction
(b) True. During rolling, the point of the body in contact with the ground does not move ahead (this would be slipping) instead, it only touches the ground for an instant and lifts off following a curve. Thus, only if the point of contact remains in touch with the ground and moves forward will the instantaneous speed not be equal to zero.
(c) False. For a rolling object, instantaneous acceleration will have a value it is not zero
(d ) True. This is because during perfect rolling frictional force is zero, so work done against it is zero.
(d)  True. This is because during perfect rolling frictional force is zero, so work done against it is zero.

(You can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises.) However, the tidal effect of the moon’s pull is greater than the tidal effect of the sun. Why?   ","(a). No, as of now, no method has been devised to shield a body from gravity because gravity is independent of the medium, and it is the virtue of each and every matter.

(b). Yes, if the spaceship is large enough, then the astronaut will definitely detect Mars’s gravity.
(c). Gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, whereas Tidal effects are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance.

(c) Hydrostatic pressure is a scalar quantity even though the pressure is force divided by area.","(a). The blood column to the feet is at a greater height than the head. Thus, the blood pressure in the feet is greater than that in the brain.
(b). The density of the atmosphere does not decrease linearly with the increase in altitude, in fact, most of the air molecules are close to the surface. Thus, there is this nonlinear variation of atmospheric pressure.
(c). In hydrostatic pressure, the force is transmitted equally in all directions in the liquid; thus, there is no fixed direction of pressure, making it a scalar quantity.",,,,,,,,

"4: Explain why
(a) To keep a piece of paper horizontal, you should blow over, not under it.
(b) When we try to close a water tap with our fingers, fast jets of water gush through the openings between our fingers.
(c) The size of the needle of a syringe controls the flow rate better than the thumb pressure exerted by a doctor while administering an injection.
(d) A fluid flowing out of a small hole in a vessel results in a backward thrust on the vessel.
(e) A spinning cricket ball in the air does not follow a parabolic trajectory.","(a) If we blow over a piece of paper, the velocity of air above the paper becomes more than that below it. As the K.E. of air above the paper increases, in accordance with Bernoulli’s theorem, its pressure energy and hence, its pressure decreases.
Due to the greater value of pressure below the piece of paper = atmospheric pressure, it remains horizontal and does not fall.
(b) As per the equation of continuity, area × velocity = constant. When we try to close a water tap with our fingers, the area of the cross-section of the outlet of the water jet is reduced considerably, as the openings between our fingers provide constriction (regions of smaller area).
Thus, the velocity of the water increases greatly, and fast jets of water come through the openings between our fingers.
(c) The size of the needle controls the velocity of flow, and the thumb pressure controls pressure.  According to the Bernoulli’s theorem  P + \(\begin{array}{l}\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } pv^{ 2 }\end{array} \) = Constant
In this equation, the pressure P occurs with a single power, whereas the velocity occurs with a square power. Therefore, the velocity is more effective compared to the pressure. It is for this reason that the needle of the syringe controls the flow rate better than the thumb pressure exerted by the doctor.
(d) This is because of the principle of conservation of momentum. While the flowing fluid carries forward momentum, the vessel gets a backward momentum.(e) A spinning cricket ball would have followed a parabolic trajectory had there been no air. But because of air, the Magnus effect takes place. Due to the Magnus effect, the spinning cricket ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory.",,,,,,,,

(d) the earth without its atmosphere would be inhospitably cold.
(e) heating systems based on the circulation of steam are more efficient in warming a building than those based on the circulation of hot water.","(a) A body with a large reflectivity is a poor absorber of heat radiation. A poor absorber will be a poor emitter of radiation. Therefore, a body with a large reflectivity is a poor emitter.
(b) Brass is a good conductor of heat, and wood is a poor conductor of heat. When we touch a brass tumbler, heat is conducted from our hand to the tumbler, and there is a drop in the body temperature; therefore, we feel cold.  When a wooden tray is touched on a chilly day, very less heat is conducted from the hand to the wooden tray, and body temperature is not decreased much. So we do not feel cold.
(c) The radiation energy from a red-hot iron piece placed in a furnace is given by the relation
E=σT4
When the iron piece is placed in the open, the radiation energy is given by the relation
E=σ(T4−T04)
Here, E is the energy radiation.
T is the temperature of the optical pyrometer.
σ is a constant.
T0 is the temperature of the open space.
The increase in the temperature of the open space reduces the radiation energy.
(d)  If there is no atmosphere, extra heat will not be trapped. All the heat from the sun will be radiated back from the surface of the earth. So without the atmosphere, the earth would be inhospitably cold.
(e) Steam at 100 0C is much hotter than water at 100 0C. This is because steam will have a lot of heat in the form of latent heat (540 cal/g).  Therefore, heating systems based on the circulation of steam are more efficient in warming a building than those based on the circulation of hot water.",,,,,,,,
Q.20. A body cools from 80 C to 50 C in 5 minutes. Calculate the time it takes to cool from 60C to 30 C. The temperature of the surroundings is 20 C.,"Here,
The initial temperature of the body, T1=80 C
The final temperature of the body, T2 = =50 C
Average temperature, (T1 + T2) /2

The temperature of the surrounding, T0 =20 C
The temperature difference, ΔT= 65 C  – 20 C = 45 C
t=5 min.
According to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference in temperature
Change in temperature/ Time = K ΔT
(T2 – T1)/t = KΔT
(80 – 50)/5 = K(45)
6 = K(45)
K = 6/45

In the second condition,
The initial temperature of the body, T1 =60 C
The final temperature of the body, T2 =30 C
Let t be the time taken for cooling.
Average temperature, (T1 + T2)/2 = (60 + 30)/2 = 45 C
Temperature difference, ΔT = 45 0C – 20 0C = 25 C
According to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference in temperature

Water is flowing at a rate of 3.0 litre/min
The geyser heats the water, raising the temperature from 270 C to 770 C.
Initial temperature, T1 = 270 C

"3. Explain why 
(a) Two bodies at different temperatures T1 and T2 if brought in thermal contact, do not necessarily settle to the mean temperature (T1 + T2)/2. 
(b) The coolant in a chemical or a nuclear plant (i.e., the liquid used to prevent the different parts of a plant from getting too hot) should have high specific heat. 
(c) Air pressure in a car tyre increases during driving. 
(d) The climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude.","(i). When two bodies having different temperatures, say T1 and T2 are brought in thermal contact with each other, there is a flow of heat from the body at the higher temperature to the body at the lower temperature till both the bodies reach an equilibrium position, i.e., both the bodies are having equal temperature. The equilibrium temperature is only equal to the mean temperature when the thermal capacities of both the bodies are equal.
(ii).The coolant used in a chemical or nuclear plant should always have a high specific heat. Higher is the specific heat of the coolant, higher is its capacity to absorb heat and release heat. Therefore, a liquid with a high specific heat value is the best coolant to be used in a nuclear or chemical plant. This would prevent different parts of the plant from getting too hot.
(iii). When the driver is driving a vehicle then due to the motion of air molecules the air temperature inside the tyre increases. And according to the Charles’ law, the temperature is directly proportional to pressure.
Therefore, when the temperature inside a tyre increases, then there is also an increase of air pressure.
(iv). The relative humidity in a harbour town is more than that of the relative humidity in a desert town. Humidity is a measure of water vapor in the atmosphere and the specific heat of water vapor is very high. Therefore, the climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude.",,,,,,,,
"4. A cylinder with a movable piston contains 3 moles of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure. The walls of the cylinder are made of a heat insulator, and the piston is insulated by having a pile of sand on it. By what factor does the pressure of the gas increase if the gas is compressed to half its original volume?","The cylinder is completely insulated from its surroundings.
Therefore, no heat is exchanged between the system (cylinder) and its surroundings.
Thus, the process is adiabatic
Initial pressure inside the cylinder = P1
Final pressure inside the cylinder = P2
Initial volume inside the cylinder = V1
Final volume inside the cylinder = V2
Ratio of specific heat, γ = Cp / Cv = 1.4
For an adiabatic process, we have:
P1V1γ = P2V2γ
The final volume is compressed to half of its initial volume
Hence,
V2 = V1 / 2
P1V1γ = P2(V1 / 2)γ
P2 / P1 = V1γ / (V1 / 2)γ
= 21.4
We get,
= 2.639
Therefore, the pressure increases by a factor of 2.639",,,,,,,,
"5. In changing the state of a gas adiabatically from an equilibrium state A to another equilibrium state B, an amount of work equal to 22.3 J is done on the system. If the gas is taken from state A to B via a process in which the net heat absorbed by the system is 9.35 cal, how much is the net work done by the system in the latter case? (Take 1 cal = 4.19 J)","Given
The work done (W) on the system while the gas changes from state A to state B is 22.3 J
This is an adiabatic process.
Therefore, change in heat is zero.
So,
ΔQ = 0
ΔW = – 22.3 (Since the work is done on the system)
From first law of thermodynamics, we have:
ΔQ = ΔU + ΔW
Where,
ΔU = Change in the internal energy of the gas
Hence,
ΔU = ΔQ – ΔW
= 0 – (-22.3 J)
We get,
ΔU = + 22.3 J
When the gas goes from state A to state B via a process, the net heat absorbed by the system is:
ΔQ = 9.35 cal
= 9.35 x 4.19
On calculation, we get,
= 39.1765 J
Heat absorbed, ΔQ = ΔU + ΔW
Thus,
ΔW = ΔQ – ΔU
= 39.1765 – 22.3
We get,
= 16.8765 J
Hence, 16.88 J of work is done by the system",,,,,,,,
"6. Two cylinders A and B of equal capacity are connected to each other via a stopcock. A contains a gas at standard temperature and pressure. B is completely evacuated. The entire system is thermally insulated. The stopcock is suddenly opened. Answer the following: 
(a) What is the final pressure of the gas in A and B? 
(b) What is the change in internal energy of the gas? 
(c) What is the change in the temperature of the gas? 
(d) Do the intermediate states of the system (before settling to the final equilibrium state) lie on its P-V-T surface?","(a). Now, as soon as the stop cock is opened the gas will start flowing from cylinder P to cylinder Q which is completely evacuated, and thus the volume of the gas will be doubled because both the cylinders have equal capacity.  And since the pressure is inversely proportional to volume, hence the pressure will get decreased to half of the original value.
Since the initial pressure of the gas in cylinder P is 1 atm, therefore, the pressure in each of the cylinder will now be 0.5 atm.
(b). Here, in this case, the internal energy of the gas will not change i.e. ΔU = 0. It is because the internal energy can change only when the work is done by the system or on the system. Since in this case, no work is done by the gas or on the gas.
Therefore, the internal energy of the gas will not change.
(c) There will be no change in the temperature of the gas. It is because during the expansion of gas there is no work being done by the gas.
Therefore, there will be no change in the temperature of the gas in this process.
(d). The above case is the clear case of free expansion and free expansion is rapid and it cannot be controlled. The intermediate states do not satisfy the gas equation and since they are in non – equilibrium states, they do not lie on the Pressure-Volume – Temperature surface of the system",,,,,,,,

Here,
Rate at which heat is supplied ΔQ = 100 W
Rate at which work is done ΔW = 75 Js-1
Rate of change of internal energy is ΔU
ΔU = ΔQ – ΔW
ΔU = 100 – 75

"11. A metre-long narrow bore held horizontally (and closed at one end) contains a 76 cm long mercury thread, which traps a 15 cm column of air. What happens if the tube is held vertically with the open end at the bottom?","Length of the narrow bore, L = 1 m = 100 cm
Length of the mercury thread, l = 76 cm
Length of the air column between mercury and the closed end, la = 15 cm
Since the bore is held vertically in the air with the open end at the bottom, the mercury length that occupies the air space is
= 100 – (76 + 15)
= 9 cm
Therefore,
The total length of the air column = 15 + 9 = 24 cm
Let h cm of mercury flow out as a result of atmospheric pressure.
So,
Length of the air column in the bore = 24 + h cm
And,
Length of the mercury column = 76 – h cm
Initial pressure, V1 = 15 cm^3
Final pressure, P2 = 76 – (76 – h)
= h cm of mercury
Final volume, V2 = (24 + h) cm^3
The temperature remains constant throughout the process.
Therefore,
P1V1 = P2V2
On substituting, we get
76 x 15 = h (24 + h)
h2 + 24h – 11410 = 0
Solving further, we get
= 23.8 cm or -47.8 cm
Since height cannot be negative. Hence, 23.8 cm of mercury will flow out from the bore.
Length of the air column = 24 + 23.8 = 47.8 cm",,,,,,,,

(a), (b) The given situation is shown in the following figure. Points A and B are the two end points, with AB = 10 cm, where ‘O’ is the midpoint of the path.

A particle is in linear simple harmonic motion between the end points. At the extreme point A, the particle is at rest momentarily. Therefore, its velocity is zero at this point. Its acceleration is positive as it is directed along AO. Force is also positive in this case as the particle is directed rightward.

At the extreme point B, the particle is at rest momentarily. Therefore, its velocity is zero at this point

(c) The particle is executing a simple harmonic motion. ‘O’ is the mean position of the particle. Its velocity at the mean position O is the maximum. The value for velocity is negative since the particle is directed leftward. The acceleration and force of a particle executing SHM is zero at the mean position.

(d) The particle is moving toward point O from the end B. This direction of motion is opposite to the conventional positive direction, which is from A and B. Therefore, the particle’s velocity and acceleration, and the force on it are all negative.

"Q4. Using the formula v = \(\begin{array}{l}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho }}\end{array} \), explain why the speed of sound in air

We know,
PV = nRT ( for n moles of ideal gas )

Therefore, P  = m (RT/M)
P = \(\begin{array}{l}\frac{\rho RT}{M}\end{array} \)
\(\begin{array}{l}\frac{P}{\rho} = \frac{ RT}{M}\end{array} \)
(a) For a gas at a constant temperature,\(\begin{array}{l}\frac{P}{\rho}\end{array} \) = constant
Thus, as P increases ρ and vice versa. This means that the P/ρ ratio always remains constant, meaning
v = \(\begin{array}{l}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho }}\end{array} \)
= constant, i.e. velocity of sound does not depend upon the pressure of the gas.
(b) Since, \(\begin{array}{l}\frac{P}{\rho} = \frac{ RT}{M}\end{array} \)
v = \(\begin{array}{l}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho }}\end{array} \) = v = \(\begin{array}{l}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M }}\end{array} \)
We can see that v \(\begin{array}{l}\propto \sqrt{T}\end{array} \), i.e. speed of sound increases with temperature.

The time taken by the S and P waves to reach the position of the seismograph is t1 and t2, respectively
l = v1t1 = v2t2
The speed of S wave, v1=4.0 km s^–1
The speed of P wave, v2= 8.0 km s^–1
4t1 = 8t2
t1 = 2t2
The first P wave arrives 4 min before the S wave.
t1 – t2 = 4 min = 4 x 60 s = 240 s
2t2 – t2 = 240 s
t2 = 240 s
t1 = 2t2 = 2 x 240 = 480 s
Therefore, the distance at which the earthquake occurs, l = v1t1 = 4 x 480 = 1920 km.",,,,,,,,
"Q27. A bat is flitting about in a cave, navigating via ultrasonic beeps. Assume that the sound emission frequency of the bat is 40 kHz. During one fast swoop directly toward a flat wall surface, the bat is moving at 0.03 times the speed of sound in the air. What frequency does the bat hear reflected off the wall?","The sound emission frequency of the bat = 40 kHz
The velocity of the bat, vb = 0.03 v
Where v is the velocity of the sound in the air
The apparent frequency of the sound hitting the wall
= 40/0.97 kHz
The frequency gets reflected by the wall and is received by the bat moving towards the wall
= (1.03 x 40 /0.97) = 42.47 kHz.",,,,,,,,
"Q28. A man standing at a certain distance from an observer blows a horn of frequency 200 Hz in still air. (a) Find the horn’s frequency for the observer when the man (i) runs towards him at 20 m/s  (ii) runs away from him at 20 m /s.
(b) Find the speed of sound in both cases.
[Speed of sound in still air is 340 m/ s]","Given,
Frequency of the horn, νH = 200 Hz
Velocity of the man, vT = 20 m/ s
Velocity of sound, v = 340 m/ s
(a) We know,
(i) The apparent frequency of the horn as the man approaches the observer is:
v’ = vH [ v/(v – vT) ]
= 200 [ 340 /(340 – 20) ]
= 212.5 Hz.
(ii) The apparent frequency of the horn as the man runs away from  the observer is:
v’’ = vH [ v/(v + vT) ]
= 200 [ 340 /(340 + 20) ]
= 188.88 Hz.(b) The speed of sound is 340 m/s in both cases. The apparent change in frequency is a result of the relative motions of the observer and the source.",,,,,,,,
"Q29. A truck parked outside a petrol pump blows a horn of frequency 200 Hz in still air.  The wind then starts blowing towards the petrol pump at 20 m/s. Calculate the wavelength, speed, and frequency of the horn’s sound for a man standing at the petrol pump. Is this situation completely identical to a situation when the observer moves towards the truck at 20 m/s and the air is still?","For the standing observer:
Frequency, νH = 200 Hz
Velocity of sound, v = 340 m/s
Speed of the wind, vW = 20 m/s
The observer will hear the horn at 200 Hz itself because there is no relative motion between the observer and the truck.
Given that the wind blows in the observer’s direction at 20 m/s.
Effective velocity of the sound, vE = 340 + 20 = 360 m/s
The wavelength ( λ ) of the sound :
λ = vE /vH  = 360/200
λ = 1.8 m
For the observer running towards the train:
Speed of the observer, vo = 20 m/s
We know,
The apparent  frequency of the sound as the observers move towards the truck is:
v’ =   vH [(v + vo)/v ]
=  200[ (20 + 340 )/ 340 ] =  211.764 Hz
As the air is still, the effective velocity of sound is still 340 m/s.
As the truck is stationary, the wavelength remains 1.8 m.
Thus, the two cases are not completely identical.",,,,,,,,
