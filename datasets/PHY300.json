        "Question": "2.1 (a) What is the volume of a cube off side 1 cm? (b) What is the surface area of a cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm? (c) What is the distance traveled for a vehicle moving at 18 km/h in 1 second?",
        "Original Solution": "(a) Volume of cube, V = (1 cm)^3 = (10^{-2} m)^3 = 10^{-6} m^3\r\n(b) Surface area = curved area + area on top /base = 2\u03c0rh + 2\u03c0r^2 = 2\u03c0r (h + r)\r\nr = 2 cm = 20 mm\r\nh = 10 cm = 100 mm\r\nSurface area = 2\u03c0r (h + r) = 2 x 3.14 x 20 (100 + 20) = 15072  mm^2\r\nHence, the answer is 15072 mm^2\r\n(c) Speed of vehicle = 18 km/h\r\n1 km = 1000 m\r\n1 hr = 60 x 60 = 3600 s\r\n1 km/hr = 1000 m/3600 s = 5/18 m/s\r\n18 km/h = = (18 x 1000)/3600\r\n= 5 m/s\r\nDistance travelled by the vehicle in 1 s = 5 m",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In part (a), the volume V of a cube is given as the cube of one of its sides. Since the side is 1 cm, we calculate V = (1 cm)^3. Step 2) Because often scientific calculations use the metric system, we convert the centimeters to meters. There are 100 cm in a meter, so 1 cm is 10^{-2} m. Substituting this into the calculation, we find our result is 10^{-6} m^3.\nStep 3) For part (b), the surface area of a cylinder is composed of the curved side area and the areas of the top and bottom circles. This can be calculated using the formula 2\u03c0rh (the curved side area) + 2\u03c0r^2 (top and bottom circles), which simplifies to 2\u03c0r (h + r).\nStep 4) We are given r = 2 cm and h = 10 cm. To match the units, let's convert these into millimeters as follows: r = 20 mm and h = 100 mm. \nStep 5) Plug these values into our formula for the surface area, we obtain: Surface area = 2 x 3.14 x 20 (100 + 20) = 15072 mm^2.\nStep 6) In the last part (c), we are given a vehicle moving at a speed of 18 km/h and we want to find the distance traveled in one second. \nStep 7) We first convert the speed into more useful units. Knowing that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hour = 60 x 60 seconds, we can convert 1 km/hr into 1000 m/3600 s = 5/18 m/s.\nStep 8) Do the same conversion for 18 km/h to get 5 m/s. This means the vehicle travels 5 meters in 1 second.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Compute the volume of a cube with side length 1 cm using cube of one of its sides. Step 2) Then convert this value from cm^3 to m^3 for standardizing the units. \nStep 3) Start solving part (b) by referring to the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, which involves summing the areas of the curved side and the two ends.\nStep 4) Convert the given radius and height from cm to mm for uniformity. \nStep 5) Substitute these converted values into the formula to get the surface area in mm^2. \nStep 6) In part (c), begin with the given speed of the vehicle in km/h.\nStep 7) Convert this speed from km/h to the equivalent m/s using a conversion factor.\nStep 8) Since we know from the conversion that the vehicle travels 5 meters every second, this is our answer for the distance traveled in 1 second."

        "Question": "2.3 A calorie is a unit of heat (energy in transit), which equals about 4.2 J, where 1J =1 kg m^2 s^\u20132. Suppose we employ a system of units in which the unit of mass equals \u03b1 kg, the unit of length equals \u03b2 m, and the unit of time is \u03b3 s. Show that a calorie has a magnitude of 4.2 \u03b1^(\u20131) \u03b2^(\u20132) \u03b3^2 in terms of the new units.\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "1 calorie = 4.2 J = 4.2 kg m^2 s^\u20132\r\nThe standard formula for the conversion is\r\nDimensional formula for energy = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left [ M^{1}L^{2}T^{-2} \\right ]\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\nHere, x = 1, y = 2 and z =- 2\r\nM1 = 1 kg, L1 = 1m, T1 = 1s\r\nand M2 = \u03b1 kg, L2 = \u03b2 m, T2 = \u03b3 s\r\nCalorie = 4.2\u03b1^(\u20131) \u03b2^(\u20132) \u03b3^2",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Look at the problem statement. We are given that 1 calorie is equivalent to 4.2 Joules. A Joule is represented as kilogram meters squared per second squared (kg m^2 s^\u20132). So, a calorie can also be represented as 4.2 kg m^2 s^\u20132. Step 2) We understand that we are aiming to convert these units into a new system: where the unit of mass (M) is \u03b1 kg, the unit of length (L) is \u03b2 m, and the unit of time (T) is \u03b3 s. Step 3) We're told that energy, which is what a calorie measures, can be represented by the dimensional formula M^1 L^2 T^-2. This is because energy depends on the mass, the square of length and time inversely proportional to the square. Recall from physics that energy is equivalent to the product of mass, the square of length divided by the square of time. Step 4) In the given formula, M1 = 1 kg, L1 = 1m, and T1 = 1s represent the standard units of mass, length, and time. On the other hand, M2 = \u03b1 kg, L2 = \u03b2 m, and T2 = \u03b3 s are the new units that we want to convert to. Step 5) Finally, place these values into the appropriate places in the formula. The energy becomes 4.2 times the mass to the power of -1, times the length to the power of -2, times the time to the power of 2. This simplifies to 4.2 \u03b1^(\u20131) \u03b2^(\u20132) \u03b3^2.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that 1 calorie is equivalent to 4.2 kg m^2 s^\u20132. Step 2) Acknowledge the new system of units given, where mass is given in terms of \u03b1 kg, length in terms of \u03b2 m, and time in terms of \u03b3 s. Step 3) Understand that when dealing with energy, the dimensional formula M^1 L^2 T^-2 is used. Step 4) Set M1 = 1 kg, L1 = 1m, T1 = 1s as the old units, and M2 = \u03b1 kg, L2 = \u03b2 m, T2 = \u03b3 s as the new units.

        "Question": "2.4 Explain this statement clearly:\r\n\u201cTo call a dimensional quantity \u2018large\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019 is meaningless without specifying a standard for comparison\u201d. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever necessary.\r\n(a) atoms are very small objects\r\n(b) a jet plane moves with great speed\r\n(c) the mass of Jupiter is very large\r\n(d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules\r\n(e) a proton is much more massive than an electron\r\n(f) the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "(a) In comparison with a soccer ball, atoms are very small\r\n(b) When compared with a bicycle, a jet plane travels at high speed.\r\n(c) When compared with the mass of a cricket ball, the mass of Jupiter is very large.\r\n(d) As compared with the air inside a lunch box, the air inside the room has a large number of molecules.\r\n(e) A proton is massive when compared with an electron.\r\n(f) Like comparing the speed of a bicycle and a jet plane, the speed of light is more than the speed of sound.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem statement implies that the concepts of 'large' and 'small' are meaningless without a suitable reference point. We can't simply call something large or small in absolute terms because these terms are subjective and need something to be compared with. It is preferred to state such terms in relative meaning, comparing them with some other quantities of the same kind. Step 2) The statement (a) 'atoms are very small objects', is reframed as 'In comparison with a soccer ball, atoms are very small.' This statement adds a reference point for comparison, in this case, a soccer ball, which is understandable and relatable for most people. Step 3) Similarly, the statement (b) 'a jet plane moves with great speed', is rephrased to 'When compared to a bicycle, a jet plane moves with high speed.' By comparing the speed of a jet plane to the relatively slow speed of a bicycle, there is a clearer understanding of the 'great speed' the jet plane moves with. Step 4) The statement (c) 'the mass of Jupiter is very large', is reframed to 'When compared with the mass of a cricket ball, the mass of Jupiter is very large.' Reframing it this way includes a reference point that provides a comparison and conveys exactly how large Jupiter is. Step 5) The statement (d) 'the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules', is made more meaningful as 'As compared with the air inside a lunch box, the air inside the room has a large number of molecules.' This conveys the density and natures of air molecules. Step 6) For the statement (e) 'a proton is a lot more massive than an electron', the reformulation would be 'A proton is massive when compared to an electron.' Although there have been changes in phrasing, the comparison between a proton and an electron is maintained to emphasise the relative mass. Step 7) Lastly, statement (f) 'the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.' is restated as 'Like comparing the speed of a bicycle and a jet plane, the speed of light is more than the speed of sound.' This creates a relative comparison using the more relatable speed difference between a bicycle and a jet plane.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the need for comparative standards when determining the size, speed, mass, or any attribute of an object. Step 2) Reframe statement (a) about atoms being small by using a soccer ball as a relatable reference. Step 3) Statement (b) about jet plane's speed is reframed by comparing it to a slower-moving bicycle. Step 4) Reformulate statement (c) about Jupiter's mass by drawing a parallel with a cricket ball. Step 5) Reframe statement (d) about the number of air molecules in a room by comparing it with the air in a lunch box. Step 6) Reframe statement (e) about the mass of a proton by comparing it with an electron. Step 7) Restate statement (f) about the speed of sound and light by creating an analogy with the speed difference between a bicycle and a jet plane."

        "Question": "2.5 A new unit of length is chosen such that the speed of light in a vacuum is unity. What is the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes 8 min and 20 s to cover this distance?",
        "Original Solution": "Distance between them = Speed of light x Time taken by light to cover the distance\r\nSpeed of light = 1 unit\r\nTime taken = 8 x 60 + 20 = 480 + 20 = 500s\r\nThe distance between Sun and Earth = 1 x 500 = 500 units",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step in this problem is to recognize the given facts. We know that the speed of light in a vacuum with the newly chosen unit is 1. We also know that it takes the light 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. Step 2) The next step is to convert this given time into seconds for convenience and standardization. We do this by multiplying the minutes by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute) and adding the remaining seconds. This gives us 8*60 + 20 which equals 480 + 20, resulting in 500 seconds. Step 3) The final step is to calculate the distance between the Sun and the Earth. We do this by applying the equation for distance, which is the speed of light (in our new unit) multiplied by the time taken by light to cover the distance. Here, the speed of light is 1 unit and the time taken is 500 seconds. So the distance is 1*500, which equals 500 units. Thus, the distance between the Sun and the Earth in our new unit of length is 500 units.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values: the speed of light in the new unit (1 unit) and the time light takes to travel from the Sun to the Earth (8 minutes 20 seconds). Step 2) Convert the given time into seconds, using the reasoning that it's the standard metric for such calculations. This results in a total of 500 seconds. Step 3) Apply the standard distance equation: Speed x Time, which in this case is 1 unit (the speed of light) x 500 seconds (the time). Hence, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 500 units in the newly established measurement system."

        "Question": "2.6 Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length?(a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale(b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale(c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "(a) Least count = 1- \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{9}{10}\\end{array} \\)= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{10}\\end{array} \\) = 0.01cm\r\n(b) Least count = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{pitch}{number of divisions}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{10000}\\end{array} \\) = 0.001 cm\r\n(c) least count = wavelength of light = 10^(-5) cm\r\n= 0.00001 cm\r\nWe can come to the conclusion that the optical instrument is the most precise device used to measure length.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start off by looking at the three different measuring devices presented and understand that the precision of a device is related to its least count, which is the smallest measurement that the device can distinguish. The lower the least count, the more precise the device is. Step 2) We first calculate the least count of the vernier calipers. The least count is found by subtracting 9/10 from 1 (the total distance covered by 20 divisions). This gives us a value of 0.01cm. Step 3) We then calculate the least count of the screw gauge. The least count of the screw gauge is computed as the pitch divided by the number of divisions, which in this case is 1 / 10000, resulting in a value of 0.001cm. Step 4) Finally, we determine the least count for the optical instrument. Given in the problem statement, the optical instrument can measure within a wavelength of light, which is equal to 10^(-5) cm or 0.00001 cm. Step 5) We now compare the least counts of the three devices. The optical instrument has the lowest least count (0.00001 cm), therefore, it is the most precise device for measuring length.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We understand that the precision of a device is indicated by its least count - the lower the least count, the higher the precision. Step 2) The least count of vernier calipers is calculated by subtracting proportion of total distance covered by the number of divisions from 1. For the example, it results in 0.01cm. Step 3) To get the least count of the screw gauge, we divide the pitch by the number of divisions. In this case we get a least count of 0.001cm. Step 4) The least count of the optical instrument is given directly as equal to a wavelength of light, which is 0.00001 cm. Step 5) The precision of the instruments are compared by looking at their least counts - here the optical instrument emerges as the most precise due to its smallest least count."

        "Question": "2.7. A student measures the thickness of a human hair by looking at it through amicroscope of magnification 100. He makes 20 observations and finds that the average width of the hair in the field of view of the microscope is 3.5 mm. What is the estimate on the thickness of the hair?",
        "Original Solution": "The average width of the hair in the field of view of the microscope = 3.5 mm\r\nActual thickness of hair =3.5 mm/100 = 0.035 mm",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start off by identifying the known values. In this problem, we know that the average width of the hair, as viewed under the microscope, is 3.5mm. We also know that the microscope is giving us an image that's magnified by a factor of 100. This means the hair we're looking at is 100 times larger than it is in reality. Step 2) To determine the actual thickness of the hair, we need to perform a division operation. Our equation is: 'Actual thickness = Apparent thickness / Magnification'. The 'Apparent thickness' here is the 3.5mm we measured under the microscope. The 'Magnification' is 100, which is our magnification factor. Step 3) So, if we plug our known values into the equation, we have 'Actual thickness = 3.5mm / 100'. This gives us a result of 0.035mm, which is the actual thickness of the hair. Since the thickness was exaggerated by the microscope, we expect that the actual thickness to be much smaller- exactly what we obtained.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the known values of the problem- The average width of the hair under the microscope (3.5mm) and the magnification factor of the microscope (100 times). Step 2) Use the equation 'Actual thickness = Apparent thickness / Magnification' to find out the actual thickness of the hair. This equation is obtained from the basic principle that magnification equals the apparent size (observed size under the microscope) divided by the actual size. Rearranging this gives us the equation we are using. Step 3) Substitute the known values into the equation to obtain the actual thickness of the hair, which turns out to be 0.035mm."

        "Question": "2.8. Answer the following :\r\n(a) You are given a thread and a metre scale. How will you estimate the diameter of\r\nthe thread?\r\n(b) A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do\r\nyou think it is possible to arbitrarily increase the accuracy of the screw gauge by\r\nincreasing the number of divisions on the circular scale?\r\n(c) The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by vernier callipers. Why\r\nis a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable\r\nestimate than a set of 5 measurements only?",
        "Original Solution": "(a) The thread should be wrapped around a pencil a number of times to form a coil having its turns touching each other closely. Measure the length of this coil with a metre scale. If L be the length of the coil and n be the number of turns of the coil, then the diameter of the thread is given by the relation\r\nDiameter = L/n.\r\n(b) Least count of the screw gauge = Pitch/number of divisions on the circular scale\r\nSo, theoretically, when the number of divisions on the circular scale is increased, the least count of the screw gauge will decrease. Hence, the accuracy of the screw gauge will increase. However, this is only a theoretical idea. Practically, there will be many other difficulties when the number of turns is increased.\r\n(c)  The probability of making random errors can be reduced to a larger extent in 100 observations than in the case of 5 observations.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In order to estimate the diameter of a thread, it should be uniformly wound onto a cylindrical object such as a pencil, ensuring that each subsequent turn, or coil, of the thread is closely touching the previous one. The uniformity and closeness of each turn is important to avoid any errors in calculation due to looseness or variations in the coils' distances. Step 2) Once we have a neatly wound coil, its total length, L, is measured using a metre scale. Make sure to measure from the start to end of the coil. Step 3) We also need to count the total number of turns, n, in the coil. Step 4) Using the formula Diameter = L/n, the diameter of the thread can be calculated by dividing the total length of the coil by the number of turns. This method is based on the circular nature of the wound thread where the diameter would equal to the length of one complete turn. Step 5) When it comes to a screw gauge, the accuracy of the instrument can be quantified using its least count, which is the minimum possible measurement that can be made. This is calculated by dividing the pitch of the screw gauge by the number of divisions on the circular scale. Step 6) In theory, by increasing the number of divisions on the circular scale, the least count of the screw gauge would decrease thereby increasing the accuracy. However, in practice, as more divisions are added, physical limitations such as readability and precision in marking the divisions may pose challenges. Step 7) In case of measuring the diameter of a thin brass rod using vernier calipers, it is statistically advisable to take more repeated measurements. When more measurements, say 100 as opposed to 5, are taken the probability of the mean diameter getting affected by random errors is reduced. The larger the sample size, the more reliable the estimate becomes, as it helps in nullifying accidental errors which may have crept in during the observation process.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Wrap the thread around a pencil uniformly to form a coil. Step 2) Measure the length, L, of the coil using a meter scale. Step 3) Count the number of turns, n, in the coil. Step 4) Calculate the diameter using the equation Diameter = L/n. Step 5) Understand that the least count of a screw gauge, which determines its accuracy, is calculated by Pitch/Total divisions on the scale. Step 6) Realize that although theoretically increasing the divisions on the scale can increase the accuracy, practical considerations limit this increase. Step 7) Learning that more repeated measurements (100 vs 5) of the rod's diameter using vernier calipers increase reliability of results as it reduces the impact of random errors."

        "Original Solution": "Arial Magnification = Area of the image/Area of the object\r\n= 1.55/1.75 x 10^4\r\n= 8.857x 10^3\r\nLinear Magnification = \u221aArial magnification\r\n= \u221a(8.857x 10^3) \r\n= 94. 1",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In this problem we're given the area of the image of a house on a slide and the area of the same image projected onto a screen. We know that the area of the image on the slide is 1.75 cm2, and the area of the image on the screen is 1.55 m2. Step 2) We're asked to find the linear magnification, which is the square root of the area magnification. The first step is to find the area magnification. We do this by taking the ratio of the area of the image on the screen to the area of the image on the slide, which equals 1.55 m2 / 1.75 cm2. Step 3) Note that we want to make sure we're working in the same unit before we do our calculations. Since 1 m = 1 x 10^2 cm, we convert 1.55 m2 to cm2 by multiplying by (1 x 10^2)^2, giving us a result of 1.55 x 10^4 cm2. Step 4) We now take the ratio of these two areas to find the area magnification. This gives us 1.55 x 10^4 cm2 / 1.75 cm2 = 8.857 x 10^3. Step 5) To find the linear magnification, we take the square root of the area magnification. So, the linear magnification is \u221a(8.857x 10^3) = 94.1. This means that the length of the house on the screen is 94.1 times larger than it is on the slide.",

In other words, they include all the reliably known digits in a number plus the first uncertain digit.\n\nStep 2) For (a) 0.007 m^2, ignore the leading zeros as they are not significant. They are only placeholders to indicate the decimal point location and do not affect the measurement precision. They are there to show that the magnitude of the size is less than 1.

        "Question": "2. 11. The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m, and 2.01 cm, respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant figures.",
        "Original Solution": "Area of the rectangular sheet = length x breadth\r\n= 4.234 x 1.005 = 4.255 m^2= 4.3 m^2\r\nThe volume of the rectangular sheet = length x breadth x thickness = 4.234 x 1.005  x  2.01 x 10^-2 = 8.55 x 10^(-2) m^3.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the given values. The length of the sheet is 4.234 m, the breadth is 1.005 m, and the thickness is 2.01 cm. These are the dimensions of the sheet. It's important to observe that thickness is given in cm, while other dimensions are in meters. To compute the area and volume of the sheet accurately, all the dimensions need to be in the same unit.\nStep 2) Use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = length x breadth. The area of the sheet in this case can be calculated as 4.234 m x 1.005 m = 4.255 m^2. According to significant figures rule, the final answer must be rounded off to the least number of decimal places in the given measurements. Hence, we round it off to one decimal point to give 4.3 m^2.\nStep 3) Convert the thickness to meters to maintain unit consistency. To convert cm to meters, multiply the measurement by 10^-2. So, the thickness becomes 2.01 x 10^-2 = 0.0201 m.\nStep 4) Use the formula for volume of a rectangle, Volume = length x breadth x thickness. Substituting the given values into the equation gives 4.234 m x 1.005 m x 0.0201 m = 8.55 x 10^(-2) m^3. We apply the same rule of significant figures here, but the answer already has sufficient number of decimal places.",

Keep in mind the significant figures rule while rounding off the final answer.\nStep 3) To ensure unit consistency, convert the thickness from cm to m using the conversion factor (1 m = 100 cm).\nStep 4) Use the formula for volume of a rectangular prism (Volume = length x breadth x thickness) and substitute the given values, which now are all in meters.

        "Original Solution": "The mass of the box = 2.30 kg\r\nand the mass of the first gold piece = 20.15 g\r\nThe mass of the second gold piece = 20.17 g\r\nThe total mass = 2.300 + 0.2015 + 0.2017 = 2.7032 kg\r\nSince 1 is the least number of decimal places, the total mass = 2.7 kg.\r\nThe mass difference = 20.17 \u2013 20.15 = 0.02 g\r\nSince 2 is the least number of decimal places, the total mass = 0.02 g.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The information provided in the problem is as follows: the mass of the box is 2.30 kg, and the masses of the two gold pieces are 20.15 g and 20.17 g. However, the gold pieces' weights are in grams, while the box's weight is in kilograms. We need to have all the weights in the same unit to perform our operations. \nStep 2) Therefore, the next step is to convert the weights of the gold pieces from grams to kilograms. We do this by dividing each gold piece's mass by 1000 because 1 kg = 1000 g. This gives us 0.2015 kg and 0.2017 kg for the first and second gold pieces, respectively. \nStep 3) To find the total mass of the box with the gold pieces inside (part a), we add the masses of the box and the two gold pieces together. Therefore, the total mass equals 2.300 kg + 0.2015 kg + 0.2017 kg = 2.7032 kg.\nStep 4) To present our answer with the correct number of significant figures, we must consider the least accurate number in our calculation, which had 1 decimal place (the mass of the box, 2.3 kg). Therefore, we round our total to one decimal place, getting 2.7 kg as the total mass of the box with the gold pieces inside. \nStep 5) For the difference in the masses of the gold pieces (part b), we subtract 20.15 g from 20.17 g to get 0.02 g. This is less significant in this case, because the masses were nearly identical, and their difference is very minute.\nStep 6) Again, we wish to present this difference with the correct number of significant figures, so we stick with our original two decimal places as in the measurements of the gold pieces, giving a final weight difference of 0.02 g.",

It asks to determine the overall percentage error in the quantity P. Given the formula of P, the percentage error in P can be derived from the rules to calculate errors in physical quantities, where the powers in the formula of the quantity become coefficients in the formula for its error. Step 2) Based on this, the formula for the percentage error in P is given by: ( \u0394P/P x 100 )% = (3 x \u0394a/a x 100 + 2 x \u0394b/b x 100 + 1/2 x \u0394c/c x 100 + \u0394d/d x 100 )%.

Our aim is to check whether each formula is dimensionally correct. In physics, an equation is dimensionally correct if all terms on both sides of the equation have the same dimensions.\n Step 2) Let's start with Formula (a). We have y = a sin (2\u03c0t/T). It's noted in the textbook solution that the dimensions of displacement y are M0 L1 T0, which represents no mass, one length, and no time. Also, they state that the dimension of variable a has the same dimensions as y (M0 L1 T0), and the sin function argument doesn't carry any dimensions (M0 L0 T0). So, fundamentally, the dimensions on both sides of the equation match, making this formula dimensionally correct.\n Step 3) Moving on to Formula (b), the textbook solution states that the equation is dimensionally incorrect. It's because the dimensions on both sides of the equation do not match up and this violates the principal of dimensional analysis.\n Step 4) Similarly, for Formula (c), the textbook solution informs us that it is also dimensionally incorrect because the dimensions on either side of the equation do not match.\n Step 5) Finally, for Formula (d), we revisit the same process as in step 2, but the given formula is slightly more complex.

Hence, the inter-atomic separation in hydrogen gas is larger than the size of the hydrogen atom.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem first gives us the size of a hydrogen molecule, which is about 1 Angstrom (A). But for our calculations, we need the radius. So, we take half of the diameter to get the radius of the hydrogen atom, which is 0.5 A. We also convert this to meters because we are working with SI units, resulting in a radius of 0.5 x 10^-10 m. Step 2) Once we have the radius, the next thing we need to find out is the volume of the hydrogen atom. This is done using the formula for the volume of a sphere, as we are assuming the hydrogen atom to be spherical. The volume is therefore given by (4/3)\u03c0r^3 where r is the radius. Plugging in our value of the radius, we find the volume to be around 0.524 x 10^-30 m^3. Step 3) Getting the volume of one single hydrogen atom is not enough, we need the volume of one mole of hydrogen atoms. As 1 mole contains Avogadro's number of atoms (6.023 x 10^23), we simply multiply the volume of one atom by Avogadro's number to get the atomic volume of one mole of hydrogen. This results in an atomic volume of approximately 3.16 x 10^-7 m^3.

Step 5) Finally, we find the ratio of the molar volume to the atomic volume by simply dividing the molar volume by the atomic volume. This ratio comes out to be approximately 7.1 x 10^4, meaning the molar volume is 7.1 x 10^4 times greater than the atomic volume.

Step 3) We also know that the principle of parallax uses a baseline which in astronomy terms is at a right angle to the line from the observer to the distant object\u2014here, the star.

        "Original Solution": "1 light year is the distance travelled by light in a year.\r\n1 light year = 3 x 10^8 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 9.46 x 10^15 m\r\nTherefore, distance travelled by light in 4.29 light years = 4.29 x 9.46 x 10^15 = 4.058 x 10^16 m\r\nParsec is also a unit of distance\r\n1 parsec = 3.08 x 10^16 m\r\nTherefore, the distance travelled by light in parsec is given as\r\n4.29 light years =4.508 x 10^16/3.80 x 10^16 = 1.318 parsec = 1.32 parsec\r\nUsing the relation,\r\n\u03b8 = d / D\r\nhere,\r\nd is the diameter of Earths orbit, d = 3 \u00d7 10^11 m\r\nD is the distance of the star from the earth, D = 405868.32 \u00d7 10^11 m\r\n\u2234 \u03b8 = 3 \u00d7 10^11 / 405868.32 \u00d7 10^11  =  7.39 \u00d7 10^(-6) rad\r\nBut the angle covered in 1 sec = 4.85 \u00d7 10^(\u20136) rad\r\n\u2234 7.39 \u00d7 10^(-6) rad = 7.39 \u00d7 10^(-6) / 4.85 \u00d7 10^(-6) =  1.52\u2033",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that light travels at a constant speed of around 3 x 10^8 meters per second. Therefore, in a year, light can travel a great distance, which we call a 'light-year'. This provides us with a way to measure very large distances, such as those in space. Each light year is approximately 3 x 10^8 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 9.46 x 10^15 meters. Step 2) Calculate the distance in meters to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to our solar system, which is 4.29 light years away. This is done by multiplying the distance in light years by the distance one light year covers, to get 4.29 x 9.46 x 10^15 = 4.058 x 10^16 meters. Step 3) Convert this distance into parsecs, another unit commonly used in astronomy. 1 parsec is equal to 3.08 x 10^16 meters. Divide the total distance in meters by this number to get the distance in parsecs. That gives us 4.058 x 10^16 m / 3.08 x 10^16 m = 1.318 parsecs, which we can round to 1.32 parsecs. Step 4) Now, let's solve for the star's parallax, which is the apparent shift in position of a nearby star when viewed from two different points in Earth's orbit six months apart. Use the equation which states that the parallax angle (\u03b8) is equal to the diameter of Earth's orbit (d) divided by the distance to the star (D). We know that d = 3 x 10^11 m and D = 4.058 x 10^16 m, so plugging these values in gives us \u03b8 = 3 x 10^11 m / 4.058 x 10^16 m = 7.39 x 10^(-6) radians. Finally, Step 5) Convert this angle from radians to arcseconds. There are about 4.85 x 10^(\u20136) radians in an arcsecond, so divide the number of radians by this number to get 7.39 x 10^(-6) radians / 4.85 x 10^(\u20136) radians/arcsecond = 1.52 arcseconds.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that the speed of light is constant, and use this to define a 'light-year', the distance light travels in a year. Step 2) Use this definition of light-year to convert the distance to Alpha Centauri from light-years to meters. Step 3) Convert this distance from meters to parsecs, another unit for astronomical distances. Step 4) Use the known values for the diameter of Earth's orbit and the distance to the star to solve for the parallax angle using the provided formula.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, you need to note down the information given in the problem. The provided distances are the distance from the Earth to Jupiter (D = 824.7 million km), and the angular diameter of Jupiter (\u03b8 = 35.72\u2033 of arc). Step 2) Convert these values to more practical units. The distance is already in km, which is useful for this problem. However, the angular diameter is often expressed in radians in physics, so convert the angular diameter from arcseconds to radians. Recall that 1 arcsecond approximates to 4.85 x 10^-6 radians. So, \u03b8 = 35.72 arcseconds = 35.72 x 4.85 x 10^-6 radians = 173.242 x 10^-6 radians.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We'll begin by observing the provided relation, tan \u03b8 = v, where \u03b8 is the angle the umbrella makes with the vertical and v is the speed of the man. Remember that, in physics, one of the basic checks we can make on equations is a dimensional analysis. If the units on each side of an equation match, there's a chance that the equation could be meaningful.\nStep 2) It's important to note that \u03b8 is an angle, and when we take the tangent of an angle, the result is a ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle, which is dimensionless. Hence, the trigonometric function tan \u03b8 is dimensionless. This means it doesn't have any units associated with it.\nStep 3) On the other hand, v is the speed of the man, which is expressed in units of distance over time, or [L1 T-1]. Looking at the units now, we see that the left-hand side of our equation is dimensionless, while the right-hand side has dimensions. Thus, dimensions of LHS do not equal to R.H.S and it contradicts the principle of homogeneity of dimensional equations.\nStep 4) Now, in order to make this equation meaningful, we have to adjust it so that both sides have the same dimensions. To do this, we'll introduce a new term, the velocity of the rain, u, which also has dimensions of speed, [L1 T-1].\nStep 5) Notice that when we divide v by u, we result in a dimensionless ratio. We let this ratio be equal to tan \u03b8, which gives us the corrected equation: v/u = tan \u03b8. This new equation is dimensionally correct because both sides are now dimensionless, and it aligns with the principle of homogeneity of dimensional equations.",

To do this we multiply 100 years by the number of days in a year (365), hours in a day (24), minutes in an hour (60), and seconds in a minute (60).

So, the density in the solid phase is greater than in the crystalline phase.\r\n",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by converting the given size of the sodium atom, which is provided in Angstroms (\u00c5), into meters. This is because all our following calculations would require the units to be in the standard SI form.

Since the radius is half the diameter, we calculate the radius as 1.25 x 10^(-10) m. \n\nStep 3) Using the radius, we can now find the volume of a single sodium atom. This can be done by using the formula for the volume of a sphere V= (4/3)\u03c0r^3, which gives us 8.177 x 10^(-30) m^3.\n\nStep 4) We move onto finding the mass of one sodium atom.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem gives us the total round-trip time for the laser light to travel from Earth, reflect off the Moon, and return to Earth. This round-trip time is 2.56 seconds. Here, we are interested in finding the one-way travel time, hence we'll need to divide this total round-trip time by 2 to get the time it takes for the laser beam to reach the Moon from Earth. Step 2) Given that the speed of light (which is the speed of the laser light) is known to be c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, we can use the basic formula in physics that distance (d) equals speed (c) times time (t). This is represented by d = c * t. But here, we're trying to find the distance that the laser travels to the Moon, not the total round-trip distance. Also, because we've already divided the total round-trip time by 2 in the first step to get the one-way travel time, our equation becomes d = c*t/2, meaning that the distance the light travels is half of the product of the speed of light and the total time. Step 3) Now we can substitute the known values into this equation to get our answer. Plugging in c = 3 x 10^8 m/s for the speed of light and t = 2.56 seconds for the total travel time, we get: d = (2.56 s * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / 2 = 3.84 x 10^8 meters.

        "Original Solution": "Speed of sound in water,v = 1450 m s^\u20131\r\nThe time between generation and the reception of the echo after reflection, 2t= 77.0 s\r\nTime taken for the sound waves to reach the submarine, t = 77.0/2 = 38. 5 s\r\nThen v = d/t\r\nDistance of enemy submarine, d  = tv\r\nTherefore, d=vt=(1450 x 38. 5) =55825 m=55.8 x 10^3 m or 55.8 km.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In this problem, a SONAR device is used to detect an enemy's submarine using ultrasonic waves. We know the speed of sound in water, v, is 1450 m s^-1, and also the time delay between the probe wave's generation and the echo's reception, 2t, which is 77.0 s. These are known or given values. Step 2) Because the time delay is two-way \u2013 going to the submarine and then returning \u2013 to find the time it takes for sound to reach the submarine, we must divide the given total time by 2. This gives us t = 77.0/2 = 38.5 s. Step 3) We can calculate the distance using the velocity-time relationship formula in physics that states velocity equals distance over time, written as v = d/t. Here, we want to find 'd,' so we rearrange the formula to isolate 'd' on one side of the formula, resulting in d = vt. Step 4) Plug the known values into the equation, t = 38.5 s and v = 1450 m s^-1, which results in d = vt = (1450 * 38.5) = 55825 m. Step 5) This is the distance, but it is usually more significant when expressed in km for such large distances. Therefore, convert meters to km by dividing the calculated value by 1000. This gives the distance as 55.8 x 10^3 m or 55.8 km.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Start by identifying the known values: the speed of sound in water (v = 1450 m s^-1) and the total time it takes for the echo to return (2t = 77.0 s). Step 2) We need to find the time it takes for the wave to reach the enemy submarine, so we divide the total time by 2 (t = 77.0/2 = 38.5 s). Step 3) The physics formula relating distance to velocity and time is v = d/t. To find the distance, we rearrange this to d = vt. Step 4) Substitute the known velocity and calculated time into the equation to find the distance (d = vt = 1450 * 38.5 = 55825 m). Step 5) Finally, convert the distance into a more appropriate unit, km, by dividing by 1000 (55.8 km). Each step follows logically from the one before, beginning from the given data, performing necessary calculations to arrive at the solution - the distance of the enemy's submarine."

        "Question": "2.31. The farthest objects in our Universe discovered by modern astronomers are so distant that light emitted by them takes billions of years to reach the Earth. These objects (known as quasars) have many puzzling features which have not yet been satisfactorily explained. What is the distance in km of a quasar from which light takes 3.0 billion years to reach us?\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "Time taken by light from the quasar to reach the observer, t = 3.0 billion years = 3.0 x 10^9 years = 3.0 x 10^9 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 s\r\n= 94608000 x 10^9  s\r\n=  9.46 x 10^16 m\r\nSpeed of light = 3 x 10^8 m/s\r\nDistance of quasar from Earth  = 3.0 x 10^8 x 9.46 x 10^16 m\r\n= 28.38 x 10^24 m",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step in solving this problem is by recognizing what we are given, which is the time light takes to travel from the quasar to the Earth. This value is given as 3.0 billion years. 'Billion' is the same as 10^9 so the time can be rewritten as 3.0 x 10^9 years. Step 2) However, to use this time correctly in the equation for speed, we need the time to be in seconds. When we convert 3.0 x 10^9 years to seconds, we multiply by the number of seconds in a year. There are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so the conversion results in 3.0 x 10^9 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 seconds. The result reduces to 9.46 x 10^16 seconds. Step 3) The next step requires using the speed of light, which is universally accepted to be 3 x 10^8 meters per second. Step 4) The distance light travels is found by multiplying the speed of light by the time it travels. In this case, we have 3.0 x 10^8 x 9.46 x 10^16 meters. The result simplifies to a distance of 28.38 x 10^24 meters from Earth.",

In which of the following examples of motion can the body be consideredapproximately a point object?(a) A railway carriage moving without jerks between two stations.(b) A cap on top of a man cycling smoothly on a circular track.(c) A spinning cricket ball that turns sharply on hitting the ground.(d) A tumbling beaker that has slipped off the edge of a table. \r\n",
        "Original Solution": "(a), (b) The size of the railway carriage and the cap is very small as compared to the distance they\u2019ve travelled, i.e. the distance between the two stations and the length of the race track, respectively. Therefore, the cap and the carriage can be considered as point objects.\r\nThe size of the cricket ball is comparable to the distance through which it bounces off after hitting the floor. Thus, the cricket ball cannot be treated as a point object. Likewise, the size of the beaker is comparable to the height of the table from which it drops.  Thus, the beaker cannot be treated as a point object.\r\n",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In this problem, we need to determine which of the presented scenarios can have the object considered approximately a point object. The key concept here is that any physical object can be treated as a point object if the distance it travels is significantly greater as compared to its size. Step 2) Let's consider each option one by one. Firstly, consider the railway carriage moving from one station to the other. The size of the carriage is tiny compared to the overall distance traveled between the stations. So, according to our key concept, the railway carriage can be considered a point object. Step 3) Next, let's look at a cap on top of a man cycling smoothly on a circular track. Much like the railway carriage in the previous example, the size of the cap is much smaller when compared to the length of the entire circular track. Therefore, the cap also satisfies our key concept and can be viewed as a point object. Step 4) Next, consider the spinning cricket ball that bounces off sharply after hitting the ground. The size of the ball would be a significant factor since the distance it covers post-bounce is comparable to its size. Therefore, based on our key concept, the cricket ball cannot be treated as a point object. Step 5) Lastly, consider the tumbling beaker that slips off the edge of a table. Similar to the cricket ball, the size of the beaker is comparable to the distance, it falls from the table. Hence, the beaker cannot be regarded as a point object based on our key concept. In conclusion, we can treat the objects in scenario (a) & (b) as point objects; they are significantly smaller compared to the distance they travel.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the key concept that an object can be considered as a point object if the distance it travels is significantly greater than its size. Step 2) Apply this concept to the railway carriage moving between stations - it can be viewed as a point object as its size is small compared to the distance travelled. Step 3) Similarly, the cap on a man cycling on a track can also be considered a point object as its size is tiny compared to the track's length. Step 4) On the other hand, the spinning cricket ball and the tumbling beaker cannot be considered point objects. This is because their sizes are not negligible with respect to the distance they cover after bouncing or falling respectively so they defy the key concept."

        "Original Solution": "Speed of the jet aeroplane, VA= 500 km/h\r\nThe speed at which the combustion products are ejected relative to the jet plane, VB \u2013 VA\r\n= \u2013 1500 km/h\r\n(The negative sign indicates that the combustion products move in a direction opposite to that of the jet)\r\nSpeed of combustion products w.r.t. observer on the ground, VB \u2013 500 = \u2013 1500\r\nVB = \u2013 1500 + 500 = \u2013 1000 km/h",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step is to identify the known quantities. The speed of the jet aeroplane, denoted by 'VA', is given as 500 km/h. Step 2) We also know that the speed of the combustion products, as seen from the jet plane (VB - VA), is -1500 km/h. The negative sign represents that the direction of the combustion products is opposite to the direction of the jet. Step 3) To find the speed of the combustion products with respect to an observer on the ground, we can denote this speed as 'VB'. Since VB - VA = -1500 km/h, we can rearrange this equation to solve for VB. So, VB = VA - 1500. Step 4) Now we replace VA with the speed of the aeroplane. Substituting 500 km/h in place of VA, we get VB = 500 - (-1500) which simplifies to VB = 500 + 1500. Step 5) Finally, performing the addition, we find that VB equals -1000 km/h.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by defining the values that are given in the problem. In this case, we know that the initial velocity of the car (u) is 126 km/h, we know that the final velocity of the car (v) is 0 km/h because it comes to a stop, and we know that the total distance that the car travels before stopping (s) is 200 m. Step 2) We need to change the unit of the initial velocity from km/hr to m/s because in our equations of motion we use the latter. To do this, we multiply the initial velocity by 1000 to convert kilometers into meters, then divide by 3600 to convert hours into seconds. So our initial velocity in m/s would be (126*1000)/3600 = 35 m/s. Note that no separate calculation is provided in your textbook solution for this step. Step 3) To find the deceleration of the car, we can use the equation v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where a is the acceleration, or in this case deceleration. Since the car is stopping, its final velocity is 0, so we rearrange the equation to solve for 'a' and get a = (v^2 - u^2) / (2s). Substituting v = 0, u = 35 and s = 200, we find a = 3.0875 m/s^2. This is the retardation of the car, and it's negative because it's slowing down. Again, the exact calculation is not provided in your textbook solution. Step 4) To find the time it took for the car to stop, we use the equation v = u + at. Since we know that the final velocity (v) is 0, we can rearrange the equation to solve for 't', the time, as t = (v - u) / a. Therefore t = (0 - 35) / -3.0875 = 11.344 seconds, which is the time it takes for the car to stop.",

The driver ofB decides to overtake A and accelerates by 1 m s^(\u20132). If, after 50 s, the guard of B justbrushes past the driver of A, what was the original distance between them?\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "Length of trains A and B = 400 m\r\nSpeed of both the trains = 72 km/h = 72 x (5/18) = 20m/s\r\nUsing the relation, s = ut + (1/2)at^2\r\nDistance covered by the train B\r\nSB = uBt + (1/2)at^2\r\nAcceleration, a = 1 m/s\r\nTime = 50 s\r\nSB = (20 x 50) + (1/2) x 1 x (50)^2\r\n= 2250 m\r\nDistance covered by the train A\r\nSA = uAt + (1/2)at^2\r\nAcceleration, a = 0\r\nSA = uAt  = 20 x 50 = 1000 m\r\nTherefore, the original distance between the two trains = SB \u2013 SA = 2250 \u2013 1000 = 1250 m",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given the problem, which states that two trains A and B, each 400 m long, are moving parallel to each other with a uniform speed of 72 km/hour. Train B tries to overtake train A, and in doing so, accelerates at 1 m/s^2. After 50 seconds, train B is just ahead of train A. We are asked to calculate the original distance between A and B. \nStep 2) We first convert the speed from km/h to m/s, to match the units of the other quantities given in the question. Hence, speed = 72 km/hr x (5/18) = 20 m/s. Both trains were initially moving at this speed.\nStep 3) We then make use of the formula of motion, which states that the total distance travelled, s, is equal to the initial speed (u) multiplied by time (t) plus half of the acceleration (a) times the time squared. In equation form: s = ut + 0.5at^2. \nStep 4) We can calculate the distance covered by train B using the above equation. Train B has an original speed of 20 m/s (uB), time of travel is 50 seconds (t) and acceleration of 1 m/s^2 (a).

Given that train A is constantly moving at the same speed and does not accelerate, so acceleration, a = 0.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem first mentions the speed of car A at 36 km/h. To use it in computations, we need to convert it to a more basic unit, meters per second (m/s). This is done using the conversion factor 5/18 (because 1 km = 1000 metres and 1 hour = 3600 seconds).Therefore, the speed of car A becomes 36 x (5/18) = 10 m/s. \n\nStep 2) Similarly, we convert the speeds of car B and C, which are both 54 km/h, into m/s, obtaining 54 x (5/18) = 15 m/s. As B and C are moving in opposite directions, we depict the speed of car C as negative, -15 m/s. \n\nStep 3) The next step is to find the relative speed of car A (VA) with respect to car C (VC) and car B (VB) with respect to A. The relative speed VAC is obtained by subtracting the speed of the car respect to which we are determining (in this case, VC) from VA, yielding VAC = VA - VC = 10 - (-15) = 25 m/s. For the relative speed of VB w.r.t A (VBA), we subtract VA from VB, which gives VBA = VB - VA = 15 - 10 = 5 m/s.\n\nStep 4) The problem states that the distance between A and B and between A and C (both denoted as AB and AC) are the same at 1 km. For computations, we should convert this into m, therefore, 1 km becomes 1000 m. \n\nStep 5) With the distance between AC and the relative speed of A w.r.t C, we find how long car C would take to cover the distance. The time taken by car C to cover the distance AC can be calculated using the relationship t = Distance / Speed, which gives, t = 1000 / VAC = 1000 / 25 = 40 seconds.\n\nStep 6) This is where we find the minimal acceleration (a) of car B needed to avoid collision. We need to use the equation of motion: s = ut + 1/2 at^2 where, 's' is the displacement (which happens to be the distance AB = 1000m), 'u' is the initial velocity (which is the relative speed of B w.r.t A = 5m/s), 't' is the time = 40s and 'a' is what we are finding. Inserting the given values gives us: 1000 = (5 x 40) + (1/2) a x (40)^2. Solving this equation for 'a' gives us a = 1 m/s^2.\n\nStep 7) Thus, the minimum acceleration of car B required to avoid an accident is 1 m/s^2.",

Step 2) We calculate the relative velocity of the buses going in the same direction as the cyclist which is Vb - Vc. Step 3) Buses passing in the same direction do so every 18 minutes, and since velocity is distance over time, we have Distance = (Vb - Vc) x 18/60. Step 4) We also know that the buses leave every T minutes, so the distance each bus travels is also equal to Vb x (T/60). Step 5) Setting those two equations equal to each other we get (Vb - Vc) x 18/60 = Vb x (T/60). We'll call this equation (1). Step 6) For buses going in the opposite direction, the relative velocity to the cyclist is Vb + Vc. Step 7) These buses pass the cyclist every 6 minutes, so our equation for distance covered becomes (Vb + Vc) x 6/60. Step 8) Since these buses also leave every T minutes, we make this equal to Vb x (T/60) giving us equation (2): (Vb + Vc) x 6/60 = Vb x (T/60).

        "Original Solution": "(a) The acceleration due to gravity always acts downwards towards the centre of the Earth.\r\n(b) At the highest point of its motion, the velocity of the ball will be zero, but the acceleration due to gravity will be 9.8 m s^\u20132  acting vertically downward.\r\n(c) If we consider the highest point of ball motion as x = 0, t = 0, and vertically downward direction to be +ve direction of the x-axis, then\r\n(i) During the upward motion of the ball before reaching the highest point position, x = +ve, velocity, v = -ve and acceleration, a = +ve.\r\n(ii) During the downward motion of the ball after reaching the highest point position, velocity and acceleration, all three quantities are positive.\r\n(d) Initial speed of the ball, u= -29.4 m/s\r\nThe final velocity of the ball, v = 0\r\nAcceleration = 9.8 m/s^2\r\nApplying in the equation v^2 \u2013 u^2 = 2gs\r\n0 \u2013 (-29.4)2 = 2 (9.8) s\r\ns = \u2013 864.36/19.6 = \u2013 44.1\r\nHeight to which the ball rises = \u2013 44.1 m (negative sign represents upward direction)\r\nConsidering the equation of motion\r\nv = u + at\r\n0 = (-29.4) + 9.8t\r\nt = 29.4/9.8 = 3 seconds\r\nTherefore, the total time taken for the ball to return to the player\u2019s hands is 3 +3 = 6 s.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem first asks about the direction of acceleration during the upward motion of the ball. The acceleration due to gravity always acts downward towards the centre of the Earth. Even when an object is moving upwards, the acceleration due to gravity still acts downwards. This is because gravity is a force exerted by the Earth that pulls objects towards its centre. Step 2) The question then asks about the velocity and acceleration of the ball at the highest point of motion. At its highest point, an object thrown upwards will have a velocity of zero. This is because it momentarily stops moving upwards before it starts its descent. However, despite the zero velocity, acceleration due to gravity still applies. Thus, the acceleration is 9.8 m/s^2 acting downwards. Step 3) For part c, we need to assign signs to position, velocity, and acceleration considering certain conditions. If we consider the point at maximum height as our origin (x = 0, t = 0) and consider vertically downward as the positive direction of the x-axis, we can determine the signs. During upward motion before reaching the highest point, position is positive (above the origin), velocity is negative (moving contrary to our predefined positive direction) and acceleration is positive (always acting downward). During the downward motion after reaching the highest point, position, velocity and acceleration can all three be considered positive as they act in the downward direction. Step 4) Finally, we are asked to calculate the peak height and the total time of flight. The initial speed (u) is considered negative under our chosen conditions because the ball is thrown upwards, contrary to our defined positive direction. The final velocity (v) at the highest point is zero as the throw reverses direction there. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is given and positive, acting downwards. Using the second equation of motion (v^2 = u^2 + 2gs), we can solve for the height (s). Subtracting u^2 from both sides and solving for s gives a height of -44.1 m. The negative sign simply represents the upward direction. For the time, we use the first equation of motion (v = u + gt) and solve for t to get time = 3 seconds. This is the time for the ball to rise and fall back to the ground. So the total round-trip time is 2*3 = 6 seconds.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that the acceleration due to gravity always acts downward, even when the object is moving in the opposite direction. This is because gravity is a constant force drawing objects towards the center of the Earth. Step 2) Understand that at its highest point, even though an object's velocity is zero, acceleration still exists due to gravity. Step 3) Establish a frame of reference\u2014choose the highest point to be the origin, consider the upward direction to be negative and downwards as positive. This influences the sign of your position, velocity and acceleration at different points of the motion. Upward motion before reaching the top gives +ve position, -ve velocity and +ve acceleration. When the ball starts descending, all three quantities are positive. Step 4) Use two equations of motion to find the maximum height (s) and the total time of flight (t). The second equation of motion is used to find the height reached by the ball, given initial velocity(u), final velocity(v) and acceleration(g). The time is found using the first equation of motion and then doubled because the time of ascent and descent are the same when there is no air resistance."

        "Question": "Q11. Read each statement below carefully and state with reasons and examples, if it is true or false; A particle in one-dimensional motion(a) with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant(b) with zero speed may have non-zero velocity(c) with constant speed must have zero acceleration(d) with positive value of acceleration must be speeding up",
        "Original Solution": "(a) True\r\n(b) False\r\n(c) True (if the particle rebounds instantly with the same speed, it implies infinite acceleration, which is unphysical)\r\n(d) False (true only when the chosen positive direction is along the direction of motion)",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's consider each statement one at a time. The first statement is: 'A particle in one-dimensional motion with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant.' - We know that the acceleration of a particle is the rate of change of its velocity. Hence, even when the speed (the magnitude of velocity) is zero at an instant, the acceleration could be non-zero if the velocity of the particle is changing direction. For example, when you throw a ball up in the air, at its highest point the speed is zero, but it still has a downward acceleration due to gravity. So, this statement is true. Step 2) Next, 'A particle with zero speed may have non-zero velocity.' - Velocity is a vector quantity; it has both magnitude (speed) and direction. But if the speed is zero, the magnitude of velocity is zero. So it is impossible for a particle with zero speed to have non-zero velocity. So, this statement is false. Step 3) Now, consider 'A particle with constant speed must have zero acceleration.' - If a particle is moving at a constant speed, it means its speed is not changing with time. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. If the velocity is not changing, then the acceleration must be zero. Further, even if the direction of motion changes but the speed remains the same, acceleration will be non-zero as velocity (which has direction) is changing, but such a case will be unphysical. Hence this statement is true. Step 4) Finally, 'A particle with positive value of acceleration must be speeding up.' - This statement depends on the chosen positive direction. If the positive direction is along the direction of motion and speed is increasing, then acceleration is positive and the particle is speeding up. However, if the positive direction is opposite to the direction of motion, then a positive acceleration could be slowing down the particle. Therefore, this statement is false.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Analyze the statement 'A particle in one-dimensional motion with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant'. Remember that acceleration is change in velocity, so even at zero speed, if there's change in velocity (like changing direction), acceleration can be non-zero; so the statement is true. Step 2) Look at 'A particle with zero speed may have non-zero velocity'. Velocity is speed with direction; thus, having speed of zero means velocity is also zero, making this statement false. Step 3) For 'A particle with constant speed must have zero acceleration', bear in mind that if speed doesn't change, its acceleration (rate of change of velocity) must be zero; so this statement is also true. Step 4) For the final statement 'A particle with positive value of acceleration must be speeding up', realize that the whether it speeds up or slows down depends on the direction of motion in relation to the positive direction; this could make the statement false."

        "Original Solution": "( a ) Let us consider an example of a football; it is passed to player B by player A and then instantly kicked back to player A along the same path. Now, the magnitude of displacement of the ball is 0 because it has returned to its initial position. However, the total length of the path covered by the ball = AB +BA = 2AB. Hence, it is clear that the first quantity is greater than the second.\r\n( b ) Taking the above example, let us assume that football takes t seconds to cover the total distance. Then,\r\nThe magnitude of the average velocity of the ball over time interval t = Magnitude of displacement/time interval\r\n= 0 / t = 0.\r\nThe average speed of the ball over the same interval = total length of the path/time interval\r\n= 2AB/t\r\nThus, the second quantity is greater than the first.\r\nThe above quantities are equal if the ball moves only in one direction from one player to another (considering one-dimensional motion).",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem begins by asking to distinguish between the total length of the path covered by an object and the magnitude of the object's displacement over the same time interval. To exemplify this, we imagine a football being passed between two players. Step 2) Displacement is defined as the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point, along with its direction. In this case, the ball is passed to Player B and immediately returned to Player A. It returns to its original position, resulting in a displacement of zero. Step 3) Meanwhile, the total length of the path is calculated as the distance covered by the ball from Player A to B, and then from Player B back to A, giving us a total of 2AB. Therefore, in this context, we see that the total length of the path is greater than the displacement. Step 4) Next, we need to distinguish between the magnitude of average velocity and average speed over the same time interval. Suppose the ball takes 't' seconds to cover the total distance. In the case of average velocity, it's computed as the magnitude of displacement divided by the time interval. Considering that our displacement is zero, the average velocity in our case also results in zero. Step 5) On the other hand, the average speed is computed as the total path length divided by the time interval, which gives us 2AB/t. This means the average speed is greater than the average velocity in this example. Step 6) The two quantities - total length of the path and displacement, or average speed and average velocity - can only be equal if the ball moves only in one direction, that is, from one player to another in a straight path. This equality is possible only in one-dimensional motion, as specified in the problem.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We look at a football scenario involving two players to illustrate the concept of path length and displacement. Step 2) Given the ball is passed back to its original position, its displacement (straight-line distance from start to finish) is zero. Step 3) The total path length, however, is twice the distance between the two players since the ball traveled this distance twice. Step 4) We then compare the magnitude of average velocity and the average speed. The average velocity is zero because the displacement is zero. Step 5) The average speed, calculated as the total path length divided by time, is greater than the average velocity. Step 6) Both scenarios can only be equal if the motion is unidirectional and in a straight line, akin to one-dimensional motion, as given in the problem."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, understand the problem. A man is walking from his home to a market which is 2.5 km away at a speed of 5 km/h. He then returns home instantly at a speed of 7.5 km/h after finding the market closed. We need to find average velocity and average speed. Step 2) To begin, we convert the given distances and speeds into standard units. Kilometers (km) are converted to meters (m) and kilometers per hour (km/h) are converted to meters per second (m/s) for consistency and ease of calculation. Hence, the distance to the market is 2500 m, speed while going to the market is 1.388 m/s and speed while returning is 2.08 m/s. Step 3) Now, to calculate the average velocity, remember that velocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. In this case, the man starts from his home, goes to the market, and then returns home. So overall, his displacement (change in position) is zero because he ends up back where he started. Thus, the average velocity is zero. Step 4) For the average speed, we first need to calculate the time taken in each direction. Remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. The time taken to reach the market is 30 minutes and the time taken to return to home is 20 minutes. Step 5) Now we calculate the average speed for different time intervals as asked in the question: i) For the interval 0 to 30 min, the man is still at the market. Hence, the total distance travelled is 2500 m or 2.5 km and the total time taken is 30 minutes. So, the average speed is distance/time which equals 5 km/h or 1.388 m/s. ii) For the interval 0 to 50 min, the man has returned home. So, the total distance travelled is 5000 m or 5 km. This implies that the average speed is 6 km/h or 1.66 m/s. iii) For the interval 0 to 40 min, the man is still on his way home. Therefore, the total distance travelled is 3750 m or 3.75 km, giving us an average speed of 5.6 km/h or 1.5625 m/s.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We identify that a man is walking a certain distance to a market and back at differing speeds. We need to find average velocity and speed for various times. Step 2) We convert distances and speeds into meters and meters per second respectively for uniformity and easier calculation. Step 3) We calculate average velocity. Keep in mind that velocity has a direction. Since the man ends up where he started, his overall displacement is zero. Therefore, the average velocity is zero as well. Step 4) We calculate the time taken to travel to the market and back using the formula time=distance/speed. Step 5) We calculate the average speed for different periods: (i) For 0 to 30 min, the man is at the market so the distance travelled is the distance to the market. (ii) For 0 to 50 min, the man has returned home so the distance travelled is twice the distance to the market. (iii) For 0 to 40 min, the man is still en route so the distance travelled is more than that to the market but less than twice the distance."

Step 2) Since the speeds of the vehicles are provided in km/h, but the muzzle speed of the bullet is in m/s, we need to convert the vehicle speeds to m/s. We do this by multiplying the km/h values by 5/18, which gives us 30*(5/18) = 25/3 m/s for the police van and 192*(5/18) = 160/3 m/s for the thief's car. Step 3) Next, to find the actual speed of the bullet. we need to add the speed of the police van to the muzzle speed of the bullet, giving us (25/3) m/s + 150 m/s = 475/3 m/s. This is because the bullet is fired from a moving vehicle, adding its speed to the bullet. Step 4) The step with most significance in this problem is finding the relative velocity of the bullet with respect to the thief\u2019s car. This is computed by subtracting the speed of the thief's car from the speed of the bullet, which results in (475/3) m/s - (160/3) m/s = 105 m/s.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first thing we must establish is the known quantity, which is the initial velocity of the ball and is given as 49 m/s. The lifting speed of the lift in the second case is also known and is provided as 5 m/s.  Step 2) Let's examine the first scenario once the values are known. In this case, the boy throws the ball upward while the lift is stationary. We're considering upward movement as positive here. Since the ball returns to the boy's hands, we understand that the total displacement (s) is zero during this journey. Step 3) With these quantities, we can use the second equation of motion, which is s = ut + (1/2)at^2. 'u' is the initial velocity, 't' is the time, 'a' is the acceleration, and 's' equal to the displacement. Step 4) We insert the known values into the equation, which gives us 0 = (49)t + (1/2) (-9.8)t^2. The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is acting downward, opposite to the direction of the ball's initial velocity. Step 5) By solving this equation, we find that t = (49 x 2)/9.8 = 10 seconds, which is the time it takes for the ball to return to the boy's hands when the lift is stationary. Step 6) Now, let's analyze the second case. Here, as the lift begins to move upward at a uniform velocity of 5m/s, the initial speed of the ball becomes 54 m/s (49 m/s + 5 m/s). Since the lift is moving upwards, the displacement of the ball would be different, and we'll mark it as s = 5t'. Step 7) With these new values, we can return to our second equation of motion, s = ut + (1/2) at^2. Looking at it, we plug in the values which gives us 5t = (54) t + (1/2)(-9.8) (t')^2. Solving this equation, we find that t' = 2(54 - 5)/9.8 = 10 seconds. Surprisingly, the time remains the same even though the lift begins to move upward. This shows the effect of relative motion.",

Apply the relative motion concept to calculate the ball's displacement against the lift. Step 6) Reuse the second equation of motion with the new values to find the time. Despite the lift being in motion, the time remains the same; thus illustrating the concept of relative motion."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Create two categories: one for scalar quantities and one for vector quantities. A scalar quantity is defined by its magnitude alone, it does not depend on the direction. On the other hand, a vector quantity is specified by both its magnitude and direction. Step 2) Evaluate each of the physical quantities and assign them to their proper category based on their definition and properties. In evaluating, you would need to understand what each quantity represents. For instance, 'mass' refers to the amount of matter in a body, which does not require direction, thus it is a scalar quantity. Step 3) Density, mass, speed, volume, angular frequency, and number of moles belong to the category of scalar quantities. For instance, 'speed' represents how fast an object moves, without considering the direction of the movement, which makes it a scalar quantity. Similarly, volume and density, being measurements of space occupied and mass per unit volume respectively, do not require a direction. Step 4) Velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, and displacement are classified as vector quantities.

        "Original Solution": "The dot product of force and displacement is the work done. Work is a scalar quantity since the dot product of two quantities is always scalar.\r\nCurrent is a scalar quantity as it is described only by its magnitude, and it is independent of direction.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) This problem refers to the concept of scalar quantities in physics. These are quantities that are fully described by their magnitude alone and do not involve a direction. In contrast, vector quantities, which are not what you are looking for in this problem, are quantities that are described by both a magnitude and direction. Vector quantities are involved in cases where directionality is important, for example in the application of forces.  Step 2) The first choice given in the solution is 'work'. The reason behind this is that the definition of work involves the dot product of force (a vector quantity) and displacement (another vector quantity). The dot product, also known as the scalar product, results in a scalar quantity, fitting the problem's requirements. This is reflected in the work-energy theorem equation, W = F.d, where W is work done, F is force, and d is displacement. Step 3) The second choice mentioned in the solution is 'current'. This is because electric current, by definition, is simply the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor. It does not depend on the direction of flow. The magnitude of current is given by the formula I = Q/t, where I is current, Q is electric charge and t is time. Therefore, current also qualifies as a scalar quantity as per our discussion in Step 1. So, based on the definitions and properties of work and current, they are both considered scalar quantities.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the concept of scalar quantities, which are quantities that are described only by their magnitude and not by their direction. Step 2) Identify 'work' as a suitable scalar quantity. This is because the work done is obtained through the dot product (scalar product) of force and displacement, both vectors, and yields work, a scalar quantity. This relationship is encapsulated in the work-energy theorem. Step 3) Recognize 'current' as another appropriate scalar quantity. The magnitude of current is the rate of the flow of electric charge, which is independent of the direction of flow. This can be expressed using the formula for electric current. Therefore, work and current are both examples of scalar quantities."

        "Original Solution": "Impulse is the product of force and time. Since force is a vector quantity, its product with time which is a scalar quantity, gives a vector quantity.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is asking us to identify the vector quantities out of the given list: Pressure, temperature, energy, time, gravitational potential, power, total path length, charge, coefficient of friction, impulse. A vector quantity is one that is characterized by both magnitude (how much) and direction (which way). Examples include velocity, force, and momentum. These are contrasted with scalar quantities, which only have magnitude and no direction, like temperature, time, and energy. Step 2) It is important here to understand that the product of a vector quantity and a scalar quantity results in a vector quantity. This is because the scalar quantity can change the magnitude of the vector, but not its direction. Step 3) Given these fundamentals, when we look at the list, impulse sticks out. This is because impulse is equal to the product of a force (a vector quantity) and time (a scalar quantity). Hence, impulse is indeed a vector quantity since it is characterized by both a magnitude (the product of force and time) and a direction (the same as the force). Step 4) There is no other quantity on the list that fits this criteria, so impulse is the only vector quantity from the provided list.",

Step 3) Using this knowledge, realize that impulse is a vector, as it is the product of force (a vector) and time (a scalar). Therefore, it has both magnitude and direction. Step 4) After scanning through the list again, confirm that impulse is the only vector quantity in the list. The remaining items listed are scalar quantities as they only define magnitude without direction."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first operation pertains to the addition of any two scalars. A scalar is a quantity that only possesses magnitude, such as mass, temperature, speed, etc. You can add two scallars together only if they both represent the same physical quantity. For example, adding mass and mass is meaningful because you obtain a total mass, but adding mass to temperature is not meaningful as the two entities are fundamentally different types of quantities. Step 2) The second operation to consider is the addition of a scalar to a vector of the same dimensions. Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction, like velocity and acceleration. Adding a scalar to a vector quantity does not make sense as they are fundamentally different in that vectors account for directionality, which scalars do not. There isn't a coherent way to add a quantity with direction to one without. Step 3) The third operation involves multiplying a vector by any scalar. A scalar multiplying a vector quantity is possible and usually changes the magnitude of the vector while retaining its direction (unless the scalar is negative, in which case the direction is reversed). An example of this is the concept of 'impulse' in physics, where Force (a vector) is multiplied by Time (a scalar) to yield Impulse. Step 4) The fourth operation examines the multiplication of any two scalar quantities which is possible, regardless of whether the scalar quantities represent the same or different physical quantities. This is a meaningful operation because scalars just adjust the magnitude of quantities and aren't concerned with any directional attributes. Step 5) The fifth operation pertains to the addition of any two vectors. Vectors can be added together, but only if they represent the same type of physical quantity. For example, you can add two velocity vectors or two acceleration vectors, but you can't coherently add a velocity vector to an acceleration vector. Step 6) The final operation is the addition of a vector component to the same vector. A vector component can be seen as part of the vector itself and, hence, adding a component of a vector to the same vector is entirely possible and meaningful.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start with the statement (a) - The magnitude of a vector is always a scalar. This is True. The magnitude of a vector refers to the 'size' or 'length' of the vector. No matter what direction a vector points in, its magnitude will always be a positive number, and positive numbers are considered scalars. Thus, the magnitude of a vector is indeed a scalar. Step 2) Now, consider statement (b) - Each component of a vector is always a scalar. This is False. The components of a vector are the projections of the vector along the axes of a coordinate system. These projections retain a directional characteristic - either positive or negative - depending on the direction of the vector component. Therefore, each component of a vector remains a vector itself. Step 3) Moving on to the statement (c) - The total path length is always equal to the magnitude of the displacement vector of a particle. This is also False. The total path length can be thought of as the 'distance covered' by a particle, which takes into account every single twist and turn made by the particle. On the other hand, the displacement is the straight-line distance from the initial to the final position, regardless of the path taken. Hence, the total path length is usually greater than the magnitude of displacement, except for when the particle moves in a straight line. Step 4) Next, we examine statement (d) - The average speed of a particle is either greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity of the particle. This is True. The average speed of a particle takes into account the total distance travelled, whereas the average velocity considers the displacement from the initial to the final position. Therefore, the average speed must be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity. Step 5) Lastly, let's look at statement (e) - Three vectors not lying in a plane can never add up to give a null vector. This is also True. Vectors can only be added graphically by placing them head to tail in a diagram, forming a triangle. If the three vectors do not lie in the same plane, they cannot form a triangle and hence, their resultant cannot be a null vector.",

Step 3) Evaluate statement (c), the total path length is always equal to the magnitude of the displacement vector of a particle, which is False as the path length is usually larger than the displacement except when the motion is along a straight line. Step 4) Evaluate statement (d), the average speed of a particle is either greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity of the particle, which is True since speed refers to the total distance covered and velocity refers to the displacement.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by focusing on what we know. The total distance travelled by the taxi is 23 km and the total time it took is 28 min. However, since speed and velocity are typically measured in km/h, we need to convert the minutes to hours. This is done by dividing 28 by 60 to get approximately 0.47 hours. Step 2) To find the average speed of the taxi, we will use the formula for speed, which states speed equals distance travelled divided by time taken. The distance travelled is 23 km and the time taken is 0.47 hours. So we divide these values to get the average speed, which comes to be approximately 49.29 km/h. Step 3) Now, let's move on to find the average velocity. The formula for velocity is similar to speed, but instead of total distance travelled, we use displacement, which is the shortest distance from the starting point to the endpoint. Even though the taxi travelled 23 km, the displacement is only 10 km because the hotel is directly 10 km away from the station. Step 4) Using this displacement and the time taken (0.47 hours), we divide 10 by 0.47 to get the average velocity, which is approximately 21.43 km/h. Step 5) Comparing the two quantities calculated, we can see that the average speed and the average velocity are not equal. The difference arises because the path taken by the car was not the shortest distance between the two points, thus making the average speed (which considers the actual path travelled) greater than the average velocity (which considers the shortest path).",

Step 3) To find the average velocity, we consider the displacement, which is the shortest distance from the station to the hotel, which is 10 km. Step 4) Divide the displacement by the time taken, similar to how we calculated speed, to get the average velocity, totaling approximately 21.43 km/h.

Here, we are interested in the time he takes to cross the river perpendicular to the current -- from one bank to the opposite bank. Step 3) By applying the basic formula time = distance/speed, we can calculate this. For our case, the distance is the width of the river (1 km), and the speed is the man\u2019s speed in still water(4 km/h), because he is swimming perpendicular to the river current. Using d=1 km and v=4 km/h in the formula yields time = 1/4 hour. Step 4) We usually measure time in minutes, so we convert hours into minutes: 1/4 hour is 15 minutes. Step 5) Next, we need to find out how far down the river the man goes when he crosses the river. This distance is due to the river flow. Step 6) Again, using the basic formula for distance (distance = speed x time), we can calculate the man's distance down the river. Here, the speed is the speed of the river (3 km/h) and the time is the time the man spends crossing the river (1/4 hour). So, using v_r=3 km/h and t=1/4 hour, we find the distance down the river to be 3/4 km.

Step 4) Use the formula for the resultant of two vectors, in which we relate the tangent of the angle beta (\u03b2) that v_wb makes with v_w (east) to the magnitudes of v_w and v_b and their angle via formula: tan\u03b2 = ((51 km/h)sin(90+45))/(72 km/h + (51 km/h)cos(90+45)). Step 5) Proceed to solve the equation. Remembering that the sine of 135 degrees equals cosine of 45 degrees and the cosine of 135 degrees equals -sine of 45 degrees. Then we have tan\u03b2 = (51km/h * sin45) / (72km/h - 51km/h*cos45). Step 6) Plug sin 45 and cos 45 as 1/\u221a2 to proceed, i.e., tan\u03b2 = 51/(72*\u221a2 - 51). Step 7) Substitute \u221a2 as approximately 1.414 and divide to achieve tan\u03b2 = 51/50.800. Step 8) Compute arc tangent of this ratio to get the angle \u03b2 in degrees, which is approximately 45.11 degrees. Step 9) However, since we have been calculating the angle with respect to East, the actual angle with respect to North will be 45 degrees (East to North) - our calculated angle (East to wind). Hence, we subtract 45 degrees to get 0.11 degrees. Step 10) This final result implies that the wind blows almost exactly East (relative to the boat), as its deviation from due East is just 0.11 degrees.",

Step 5) Substitute for sin(135 degrees) and cos(135 degrees) by noting their relations with sin(45 degrees) and cos(45 degrees). Step 6) Substituting sin45 and cos45 as reciprocal of square root of 2. Step 7) Simplify \u221a2 as approximately 1.414 to proceed further. Step 8) Calculate the arctan of the obtained ratio to get the approximate angle. Step 9) Subtract 45 degrees because we want the direction relative to the north instead of the east.

        "Question": "Q16: A cricketer can throw a ball to a maximum horizontal distance of 100 m. How high above the ground can the cricketer throw the same ball?\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "The maximum horizontal distance, R = 100 m\r\nThe cricketer will only be able to throw the ball to the maximum horizontal distance when the angle of projection is 45\u00b0, i.e., \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\theta\\end{array} \\) = 33.60\u00b0\r\nThe horizontal range for a projection velocity v is given as\r\nR = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{u^{2}\\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}100 = \\frac{u^{2}}{g}\\sin 90^{\\circ}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{u^{2}}{g} = 100\\end{array} \\) \u2014\u2014 (i)\r\nThe ball will achieve the max height when it is thrown vertically upward.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the question, we know that the maximum horizontal distance a cricketer can throw a ball is 100 m. This is represented in the problem as R, which we know equals 100 m. Step 2) We understand that this maximum horizontal distance is achieved when the ball is thrown at a 45-degree angle. This optimal throw angle is denoted as theta or \u03b8, which in this case is 45 degrees. Step 3) We can extract a physics formula for the horizontal range for a projected object, given a projection velocity (u) and gravity (g). This formula is R = (u\u00b2sin(2\u03b8))/g. Step 4) Next, we substitute values we know into this formula, interpreting it for the specific problem given. We plug in 45 degrees for theta and 100 m for R. Then we solve for u\u00b2/g, which equals 100 m. That's equation (i). Step 5) The next part of our solution involves considering when the ball reaches its maximum height. When thrown vertically upwards, the final velocity (v) of the ball is 0 m/s at the maximum height (H). Here, the acceleration (a) is equal to -g because the ball is accelerating downwards due to gravity. Step 6) We use the third equation of motion to calculate the height at this point. The formula states v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 - 2gH. We know that v equals 0, thus the equation simplifies to 0 = u\u00b2 - 2gH. We rearrange this equation to find H = u\u00b2/2g. However, from our first equation, we found u\u00b2/g equals 100 m. Step 7) When we replace this value in our height equation, we find H = 0.5 \u00d7100 = 50 m. Therefore, the cricketer can throw the ball 50m above the ground.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We start by understanding the maximum horizontal distance a cricketer can throw a ball is 100 m. Step 2) We identify that this maximum distance is reached when the ball is thrown at a 45 degree angle. Step 3) Using the physics formula for horizontal range, R = (u\u00b2sin(2\u03b8))/g, and substituting our known values, we calculate u\u00b2/g = 100 m. This gives us a more general understanding of the relationship of the projection velocity to gravity. Step 4) We then consider when the ball reaches its maximum height, which occurs when the ball is thrown vertically upwards and velocity v = 0. The acceleration at this point is -g due to gravity. Step 5) We use the third equation of motion, v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 - 2gH for calculation of height. We know from the first equation that u\u00b2/g is equal to 100 m. Step 6) Substituting these known values into our height equation, we find that the height above the ground that the cricketer can throw the ball is 50 m."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the provided values: The string's length is given as 80 cm, which needs to be converted into meters. Therefore, we have l = 80 cm = 0.8 m. We're also told that the stone makes 14 revolutions in 25 seconds. Step 2) Determine the frequency (v) using the provided equation v = Number of revolutions / Time taken. Taking the number of revolutions as 14 and the time taken as 25 seconds, we get v = 14/25 Hz. This is the rate at which the stone is making revolutions per second. Step 3) Compute the angular frequency (\u03c9), which is related to the frequency we just computed using the equation \u03c9 = 2\u03c0v. By substituting v = 14/25 into this equation, we can calculate the angular frequency using \u03c9 = 2 * (22/7) * (14/25) = 88/25 rad s^-1. It's important to note that the term 'rad s^-1' denotes that the angular frequency is measured in radians per second. Step 4) Discuss the centripetal acceleration's direction. In physics, there is a rule that the direction of the centripetal acceleration in a circular motion is always directed along the string towards the center. Hence, no matter where the stone is in its circular path, the acceleration will always point to the center of the circular path.",

        "Original Solution": "Radius of the loop, r = 1 km = 1000 m\r\nSpeed, v = 900 km h^-1 = \\(\\begin{array}{l}900 \\times \\frac{5}{18}\\end{array} \\) = 250 ms^-1\r\nCentripetal acceleration: \\(\\begin{array}{l}a_{c} = \\frac{v^{2}}{r}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\left (250 \\right )^{2}}{1000}\\end{array} \\) = 62.5 ms^-2\r\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms^-2",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the known values: We're given that the radius of the plane's loop is 1km, so r = 1 km = 1000 m (we convert the radius into meters because in physics, it's generally beneficial to work with SI units). The speed is 900 km h^-1, and we'll need to convert this into meters per second, v = 900 km h^-1 = 900 * 5/18 = 250 m/s. The acceleration due to gravity is a standard constant, g = 9.8 m/s^2. Step 2) We're asked to compare the centripetal acceleration of the plane with gravity. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a_c = v^2/r. We already know the values for v and r, so we can simply substitute these into the equation to get the value of centripetal acceleration. Step 3) The calculation of centripetal acceleration will be a_c = (250)^2/1000 = 62.5 m/s^2. Step 4) Now that we have both the value of the centripetal acceleration and the acceleration due to gravity, we can compare the two. When we look at the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s^2) and the centripetal acceleration (a_c = 62.5 m/s^2), we can see that the centripetal acceleration is significantly greater. The plane is experiencing forces around 6.4 times greater than the force of gravity when executing the loop.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert all given values to SI units: the radius (r) of the plane's loop is 1km, which is 1000 m in SI units. The speed (v) is given as 900 km h^-1 but we want it in m/s, so we convert to get 250 m/s. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is a constant 9.8 m/s^2. Step 2) Use the formula for centripetal acceleration: a_c = v^2/r. This formula relates the speed of an object moving in a circular path to its acceleration towards the centre of that circle, which is what we're looking for in this problem. Step 3) Substitute v and r into the formula to calculate the centripetal acceleration. Step 4) Compare this centripetal acceleration to the acceleration due to gravity.

        "Original Solution": "(a) False\r\nThe net acceleration of a particle in a circular motion is always directed along the radius of the circle toward the centre only in the case of uniform circular motion.\r\n(b) True\r\nAt a point on a circular path, a particle appears to move tangentially to the circular path.\r\n(c) True\r\nIn uniform circular motion (UCM), the direction of the acceleration vector points toward the centre of the circle. However, it constantly changes with time. The average of these vectors over one cycle is a null vector.\r\n",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with examining the statement (a), which says 'The net acceleration of a particle in a circular motion is always along the radius of the circle towards the centre.' This statement is false since it holds true only in the case of uniform circular motion. To understand why, remember that in a circular motion, there are two components of acceleration: the radial or centripetal acceleration (always directed towards the centre of the circle) and the tangential acceleration (responsible for the change in speed). In uniform circular motion, the speed remains constant, which means that the tangential acceleration is zero. This leaves us with only the centripetal acceleration which is always directed along the radius of the circle towards the centre.\nStep 2) For the statement (b) which says 'The velocity vector of a particle at a point is always along the tangent to the path of the particle at that point', it is true. This can be understood visually. If you draw a circular path, the velocity vector is always tangent to the path at any point in time, following the direction of the motion of the particle. Essentially, the velocity is the rate of change of displacement, and since the displacement is tangential to the direction of motion, the velocity vector also follows an equivalent path.\nStep 3) Lastly, we look at statement (c) 'The acceleration vector of a particle in uniform circular motion averaged over one cycle is a null vector.' This statement is true. In uniform circular motion, while the speed of the particle remains constant, the direction of the velocity vector constantly changes, thus leading to a non-zero acceleration that is taken towards the center of the circular path. However, when you average these vectors over a complete cycle, you would realize that equally sized acceleration vectors are pointing in opposite directions at opposite points in the circle, cancelling each other out. After cancelling out all the acceleration vectors over the whole cycle, the net result is a null vector.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) The statement (a) 'The net acceleration of a particle in a circular motion is always along the radius of the circle towards the centre' is false, the truth of which depends on whether the circular motion is uniform or non-uniform, the acceleration in uniform circular motion is always directed towards the centre of the circle, while in nonuniform circular motion there is also a tangential component of acceleration.\nStep 2) For statement (b) 'The velocity vector of a particle at a point is always along the tangent to the path of the particle at that point', it important to know that in circular motion, the direction of the velocity vector is always tangent to the path of the particle, creating the truth of this statement. This is due to the concept of velocity being the rate of change of displacement. \nStep 3) In regards to statement (c) 'The acceleration vector of a particle in uniform circular motion averaged over one cycle is a null vector', it is true because the vectors over one complete cycle cancel each other out leading to a null vector."

Therefore, the velocity is given by v = dr/dt, and the acceleration is a = dv/dt. Step 3) Now, calculate the derivative of the position vector to find the velocity. This yields the vector v = 3.0 \u012b \u2013 4.0t j\u0302, as each component of the vector is differentiated separately. Step 4) Find the acceleration by taking the derivative of the velocity vector.

The initial velocity is given as 10 j m/s (which signifies that the particle is moving in the y-direction), and the acceleration is given as (8.0 i + 2.0 j) m/s^2 (which signifies that the particle is experiencing constant acceleration in both x and y-directions).

Substitute the given acceleration into this equation to get dv = (8.0 i + 2.0 j) dt. Step 3) Integrate both sides of this equation. The integration of the left-hand side gives the change in velocity from the initial velocity at t = 0, denoted by the velocity vector 'u'. Step 4) 'v' is velocity which can also be represented as dr/dt, where 'dr' is the change in position.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Recognize that the problem is about vector components. We're given unit vectors i and j, they are along the x and y axis respectively. Step 2) We have to find out what happens when we add i and j. That's the vector i + j. The premise is that the magnitude of i and j is 1, so by using the Pythagorean theorem, magnitude of i + j, will be \u221a(1^2+1^2) = \u221a2. Step 3) We display this vector in a chart, forming a right triangle with sides of unit 1. The angle \u03b8 this vector forms with the x-axis can be found using trigonometry. The answer is 45 degrees. Step 4) Now consider the vector i - j. By using the same Pythagorean theorem, we can find its magnitude which is \u221a(1^2+(-1)^2) = \u221a2. Step 5) We can also place this vector in a diagram and see that it's forming an angle of -45 degrees with the x-axis. This shows how we got different angles for different vector conditions. Step 6) The components of vector A = 2i + 3j along the directions of i + j and i - j is a bit more complex to derive. By knowing that the given vector A resolved along i + j or i - j directions will each form an angle \u03b8\u2019 with i + j, and \u03b8\u201d with i - j. To find the component of A in the direction of i + j, we find |A| cos \u03b8\u2019 along i + j, which is mathematically represented as (\u221a13 cos 11.31) * (i + j)/\u221a2 = 2.5(i + j) which equals 5/\u221a2 when simplified. Step 7) Similarly, to find the component in the direction of i - j, we find |A| cos \u03b8\u201d along i - j, which results in \u221a13 cos (90.1.31) *(i - j)/\u221a2 which gives us the value of -0.5(i - j), then simplified to -1/\u221a2.

Step 3) Similarly, for the vector i-j, its magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem, which results in \u221a2, and the angle it forms with the x-axis is -45 degrees. Step 4) Now, for the vector A=2i+3j, we are trying to find its components along i+j and i-j. This is done using the concept of vector resolution. Step 5) The component of A in the direction of i+j is acquired by first finding |A|cos\u03b8' along i+j, simplifying the derived equation, we get the value as 5/\u221a2.

Hence, this equation cannot represent the motion of a particle in space.\r\n(e) True\r\nThe arbitrary motion of the particle can be represented by this equation.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with the given problem, which asks us to test out every relation for any random or arbitrary motion in space. An arbitrary motion means that we're not setting any specific rules or parameters about how the object is moving. With this in mind, we have five relationships or equations involving velocity (v), acceleration (a), radius or displacement (r), time (t), and their average or initial values. It's clear the solution to the problem involves verifying which of these relationships hold true, irrelevant of the motion's specifics. Step 2) Let's examine the first relation (a). Here, v-average is equal to the average of the velocity at times t1 and t2. However, this assumes that the velocity is changing at a constant rate between t1 and t2, which we cannot guarantee for arbitrary motion. Thus, it's false because the motion's arbitrary nature contradicts the assumption of constant velocity change. Step 3) Next, we cross-examine relation (b). Here, v-average equals displacement (r(t2) - r(t1)) divided by the time interval (t2-t1). This is the definition of average velocity, regardless of whether the motion is constant or changing. Hence, this equation is true. Step 4) We cross-verify then relation (c), which dictates that v(t) equals the initial velocity plus acceleration times time. The issue here is similar to relation (a). It assumes that acceleration is constant, but it may not be for arbitrary motion. Hence, this equation is false. Step 5) Now, we check relation (d) which involves displacement (r(t)) equaling initial displacement plus initial velocity times time, and half of acceleration times square of time. Again, we encounter the issue of assuming constant acceleration, this equation is therefore false. Step 6) Lastly, we validate relation (e). Here, a-average equals the change in velocity (v(t2) - v(t1)) divided by the time interval (t2-t1). This is the definition of average acceleration, and it remains true regardless of whether the motion is arbitrary or not. Therefore, this equation is true.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin by interpreting the problem and the variables involved in the given equations. Understand that we're dealing with arbitrary motion, or motion without specific rules or patterns. Step 2) Investigate the first relation (a), which assumes a constant velocity change, contradicting the arbitrary nature of the motion in consideration, which leads us to discard it. Step 3) Examine the second relation (b), which describes the definition of average velocity, applicable to any type of motion, hence we accept it. Step 4) Scrutinize relation (c), which, similar to the first relation, assumes constant acceleration. But, in an arbitrary motion, it is unwise to assume constants, thus, we reject it. Step 5) Investigate relation (d), which, like the previous one, assumes a constant acceleration which may not be the case in arbitrary motion, hence we discard it. Step 6) Validate relation (e), which defines average acceleration, that remains true for arbitrary motion as well, thus we accept it. As a result, relations (b) and (e) remain true for arbitrary motion."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We're going to investigate each statement one at a time. Let's start with the first one - 'A scalar quantity is one that is conserved in a process'. Conservation laws involve certain physical quantities remaining constant throughout a process. It's important to clarify that the nature of being scalar or vector doesn't determine the conservation property. An example proves this false: energy is a scalar quantity, but it's not conserved in inelastic collisions where kinetic energy is not preserved but transformed into other forms. \nStep 2) Now consider the second statement - 'A scalar quantity can never take negative values'. It's incorrect to say that a scalar quantity can never be negative. We know that temperature, a scalar quantity, can take negative values, particularly in temperature scales like Celsius and Kelvin where zero is not the lowest limit.\nStep 3) Next, assess the third statement - 'A scalar quantity must be dimensionless'. This is not true. A scalar quantity can have dimensions. For instance, the total path length is a scalar quantity and it certainly has the dimension of length.\nStep 4) Now let's explore the fourth statement - 'A scalar quantity does not vary from one point to another in space'. To understand why this is false, consider a scalar quantity such as gravitational potential. It can vary from one point to another in space because the strength and direction of the gravitational field varies.\nStep 5)Lastly, inspect the fifth statement - 'A scalar has the same value for observers with different orientations of axes'. This statement is true. The fundamental property of scalar quantities is that their values remain unchanged regardless of the observer's orientation of axes. In other words, scalars are independent of the coordinate system.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We evaluate each statement individually. The first statement that scalar quantities are conserved in a process is false - we know energy is a scalar quantity, but it's not conserved in inelastic collisions.\nStep 2) The second assertion that scalar quantities can't be negative is also false - temperature is a scalar that can be negative.\nStep 3) The third pronouncement that all scalar quantities must be dimensionless is incorrect - quantities like total path length are scalar but have dimensions.\nStep 4) The fourth proposition that a scalar doesn't vary from one point to another in space is false - gravitational potential, a scalar, does vary from point to point.\nStep 5) Finally, the fifth postulation that a scalar value is the same for different observers regardless of their axis orientation is accurate - this is a fundamental property of scalars."

        "Question": "Q25. An aircraft is flying at a height of 3400 m above the ground. If the angle subtended at a ground observation point by the aircraft positions 10.0 s apart is 30\u00b0, what is the speed of the aircraft?",
        "Original Solution": "Height at which the aircraft is flying = 3400 m\r\nLet A and B be the positions of the aircraft, making an angle \u2220AOB = 300. The perpendicular OC is drawn on AB. Here, OC is the height of the aircraft, which is equal to 3400 m and \u2220AOC =  \u2220COB = 150.\r\nIn the \u0394AOC, AC = OC tan 150 = 3400 x 0.267 = 910.86 m\r\nAB = AC + CB = AC + AC = 2 AC = 2 x 910.86 m\r\nSpeed of the aircraft = distance AB/time = (2 x 910.86)/10= 182.17 m/s =182.2 m/s",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, let's understand that the aircraft, while moving with respect to a point O on the ground, forms an angle of 30\u00b0. Imagine a triangle between the positions of the aircraft 10 seconds apart (point A and B) with point O as the vertex. The height from the ground point to the aircraft serves as the perpendicular side (OC) of two right-angled triangles (triangles AOC and COB) with the hypotenuse being the path of the aircraft over the 10 seconds. Given, the height OC of the aircraft is 3400 m. \n Step 2) Now given \u2220AOB = 30\u00b0, we can easily see that in triangle AOC, \u2220AOC = \u2220COB =15\u00b0 due to symmetry (360\u00b0 of circle/2). \n Step 3) We can now use the tangent of the angle to find the adjacent side (AC = CB) of each of these right triangles. The formula for tangent, tan \u03b8 = OC/AC, can be rearranged to solve for AC: i.e. AC = OC / tan 15\u00b0. By plugging in OC = 3400 m and tan 15\u00b0 = 0.267, you get AC = 3400 / 0.267 = 910.86 m. This is the distance covered by the aircraft in the first 5 seconds and the same distance is covered in the next 5 seconds due to uniform speed. \n Step 4) So the total distance travelled, AB, by the aircraft in 10 seconds is twice the distance of AC. Therefore, AB = AC + CB = AC + AC = 2 * AC = 2 * 910.86 m. \n Step 5) Now that we know the distance travelled and the time taken, we can use the formula of speed to solve for the speed of the aircraft. Speed = distance/time. Substituting our calculated value for distance and given value for the time we get: Speed = AB / time = (2 * 910.86 m) / 10 s = 182.17 m/s. Rounding the speed to the correct number of significant figures gives us the final answer of 182.2 m/s.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) The aircraft creates two right triangles AOC and COB with the height from ground (OC) being 3400 m. \n Step 2) The angles \u2220AOC and \u2220COB are half the total angle subtended by the aircraft at ground point O, which is 15\u00b0 (as given \u2220AOB = 30\u00b0). \n Step 3) Using the tangent formula, rearrange to find AC = OC / tan \u03b8 and substitute OC = 3400m and tan 15\u00b0 to calculate AC. \n Step 4) The total distance travelled AB = 2 * AC is calculated to understand the distance the aircraft moved in 10 seconds. \n Step 5) By using the speed = distance/time equation, plug in the calculated distance AB and given time 10 seconds to find the speed of the aircraft."

        "Question": "Q26: Does a vector have a location in space? Will it fluctuate with time?  Can two equivalent vectors, x and y, at various locations in space fundamentally have indistinguishable physical effects? Give cases in support of your answer.\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "No, Yes and No.\r\nA vector in space has no distinct location. The reason behind this is that a vector stays invariant when it displaces in a way that its direction and magnitude do not change. Although, a position vector has a distinct location in space.\r\nA vector changes with time. For instance, the velocity vector of a ball moving with a specific speed fluctuates with time.\r\nTwo equivalent vectors situated at different locations in space do not generate the same physical effect. For instance, two equivalent forces acting at different points on a body tend to rotate the body, but the combination will not generate the equivalent turning effect.\r\n",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The question asks whether a vector has a specific location in space. We answer this by defining the nature of a vector, which is that it represents a quantity that has both direction and magnitude, but not a specific position. This means that vectors do not adhere to a specific location in space as they can be displaced in such a way that their direction and magnitude remain unchanged. The only exception to this rule is position vectors, which do have a distinct location in space because they represent a specific position relative to the origin. Step 2) The second question is about whether a vector fluctuates with time. Like most physical variables, vectors can change over time. An example would be the velocity vector of a ball moving at a certain speed. As the ball's direction and speed changes with time, the vector representing it will also evolve. Step 3) The third question asks whether two equivalent vectors located differently in space can have the same physical effect. Despite having the same magnitude and direction, vectors located at different positions can indeed produce different physical effects. Consider as an example two equivalent forces applied at different points of a body. These forces may generate a rotation, and even though they're equivalent, they won't produce the same rotational effect when combined because their effect depends on their position relative to the rotational axis.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Define the nature of a vector, which has a direction and magnitude without a specific position, as they can be moved within space as long as the direction and magnitude remains constant. The only exception is position vectors which define a specific location relative to the origin. Step 2) Acknowledge that vectors can vary with time. Use the example of a ball's velocity vector, which changes as the ball's speed and direction evolve. Step 3) Explain that even if they have the same magnitude and direction, vectors located in different places can have different physical effects. As an illustration, point out that equivalent forces acting on different parts of an object can cause different rotational effects because the effect of a torque depends not just on the force, but also its position relative to the axis of rotation."

However, while these are the characteristics of a vector, they are not the only prerequisites for a quantity to be considered a vector.

        "Original Solution": "A bullet is fired at an angle = 30\u00b0\r\nThe bullet hits the ground at a distance of 3km = 3000 m\r\nHorizontal range, R = u^2 sin2\u03b8/g\r\n3000 = u^2 sin 600/9.8\r\nu^2 = (3000 x 9.8)/(\u221a3/2)\r\n= 2 (3000 x 9.8)/\u221a3 = 58800/1.732 = 33949\r\nAlso, R\u2019 = u^2 sin 2\u03b8/g = 5000 = (33949 x sin2\u03b8)/9.8\r\nSin 2\u03b8 = (5000 x 9.8)/33949 = 49000/33949  =1.44\r\nThe sine of an angle cannot be more than 1. Therefore, a target 5 km away cannot be hit",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin by stating the known values provided in the question. The bullet is fired at an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal and hits the ground 3 km away, which equals 3000 m. We want to find out if it is possible to hit a target 5 km (or 5000 m) away by adjusting the angle of projection. Step 2) The equation to find the horizontal range for a projectile is given by R = u^2 sin 2\u03b8/g, where u is the initial velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and \u03b8 is the firing angle. This equation comes from the physics of projectile motion. Step 3) Substitute values into the equation and solve for u^2. This gives us u^2 = (3000 x 9.8)/(\u221a3/2), from which we simplify to get u^2 = 22960.789 m^2 per second^2. Step 4) Now let's consider the range at our new target distance (R\u2019). The same equation is used, but instead of solving for initial velocity, we are now solving for the necessary angle, by using the equation R\u2019 = u^2 sin 2\u03b8/g = 5000. We will input the known parameters in order to solve for sin 2\u03b8. Step 5) Substitute values into this equation to get sin 2\u03b8 = (5000 x 9.8)/33949 = 1.44. Step 6) It is known in math that the sine of an angle cannot be more than 1. Therefore, because our value is 1.44, which is greater than 1, it is not possible to hit a target 5 km away by adjusting the angle of projection.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known parameters: the initial firing angle, range, and the desired new range. Step 2) Use the range equation for projectile motion to solve for the bullet's initial velocity squared. Step 3) Plug the known values into the equation to calculate the initial velocity. Step 4) Use the same equation but solve for the firing angle needed to reach the new target range. Step 5) Plug values into this equation to solve for the theoretical required angle.

        "Question": "Q31.  A cyclist is riding with a speed of 27 km/h. As he approaches a circular turn on the road of a radius of 80 m, he applies brakes and reduces his speed at the constant rate of 0.50 m/s every second. What is the magnitude and direction of the net acceleration of the cyclist on the circular turn?\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "Speed of the cyclist = 27 km/h = 27 x (5/18) = 7.5 m/s\r\nThe radius of the road = 80 m\r\nThe net acceleration is due to the braking and the centripetal acceleration.\r\nDue to braking, a =  0.50 m/s^2\r\nCentripetal acceleration, a = v2/2 = (7.5)2/80 = 0.70 m/s^2\r\nSince the angle between ac and aT is 90o, the resultant acceleration is given by\r\n= 0.86 m/s^2\r\nand tan \u03b2 = ac/at = 0.7/0.5 = 1.4\r\n\u03b2 = tan^(-1) (1.4) = 54.50 from the direction of velocity",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem states that the initial speed of the cyclist is 27 km/h. Since we need the speed in m/s for our calculations, we convert this value by using a conversion factor of 5/18. This gives us 27 x (5/18) = 7.5 m/s. Step 2) The problem also provides us with the radius of the circular turn, 80 m. Step 3) On this circular turn, the cyclist experiences two types of acceleration: 'due to braking' and 'centripetal acceleration'. These two accelerations happen simultaneously and are orthogonal to each other. Thus, they yield a net acceleration on the cyclist. Step 4) The provide that 'due to braking', the speed of the cyclist is reduced at a constant rate of 0.50 m/s each second. This constant rate of speed reduction is the acceleration due to braking, a = 0.50 m/s^2. Step 5) To calculate the 'centripetal acceleration', we apply the physics formula v^2/r, where v is the speed of the cyclist and r is the radius of the turn. This gives us (7.5)^2 / 80 = 0.70 m/s^2. Step 6) To calculate the 'net acceleration', we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the net acceleration (resultant) is equal to the square of the acceleration due to braking plus the square of the centripetal acceleration. The net acceleration works out to be the square root of (0.50^2 + 0.70^2) = 0.86 m/s^2. Step 7) It's also mentioned in the problem to find the direction of the net acceleration. For this, we use the relationship tan \u03b2 = a_c/a_t, where '\u03b2' is the angle made by the resultant acceleration with the direction of initial velocity, 'a_c' is centripetal acceleration and 'a_t' is acceleration due to braking. On solving, we get tan \u03b2 = 0.7/0.5 = 1.4, which is equivalent to \u03b2 = tan^(-1)(1.4) = 54.50 degrees.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given that a projectile has been fired at an angle \u03b8 w.r.t the x-axis where \u03b8 is a function of time. It indicates that the angle at which the projectile is moving changes with time. Step 2) The velocity of the projectile can be split into two components, horizontal (V0x = vx) and vertical (v0y - gt = vy). The vertical component of velocity changes with time due to gravity, and so we represent it using the equation vy = v0y - gt. Step 3) To determine the angle at any point of time, we use the tangent of the angle \u03b8(t), which is the ratio of the vertical velocity to the horizontal velocity. Therefore, tan \u03b8(t) = vy/vx = (voy \u2013 gt)/v0x. Step 4) To find \u03b8(t) itself, we take the inverse tangent of the above expression, giving us \u03b8(t) = tan -1 ((voy \u2013 gt)/v0x). Step 5) Next, let's consider the projection angle \u03b80. This relies on two parameters: the maximum height, denoted by hmax, and the horizontal range of the motion, denoted by R.

Solving this equation can help us find the projection angle \u03b80.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) State the problem and outline your approach. It is asked to determine the net force acting on various objects under different conditions. The net force can be determined using Newton's second law: F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. Also, when an object is at equilibrium (either at rest or moving with a constant velocity), the net force acting on the object is zero.\nStep 2) Analyze the case of the raindrop. When a raindrop falls at a constant speed, its acceleration is zero because there is no change in its velocity.

Therefore, the net force on the raindrop is zero.\nStep 3) Move on to the cork floating in water. The cork is at equilibrium because the weight of the cork is exactly balanced by the upward force (upthrust) from the water. Equilibrium implies that the net force is zero.

        "Original Solution": "(a) During the upward motion of the pebble, the acceleration due to gravity acts downwards, so the magnitude of the force on the pebble is\r\nF = mg = 0.05 kg x 10 ms^(-2) = 0.5 N\r\nThe direction of the force is downwards\r\n(b) During the downward motion also the magnitude of the force will be equal to 0.5 N and the force acts downwards\r\n(c) If the pebble is thrown at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the horizontal direction, it will have both horizontal and vertical components of the velocity.

This component will not have any effect on the force acting on the pebble. The direction of the force acting on the pebble will be downwards and the magnitude will be 0.5 N because no other force other than acceleration acts on the pebble.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that the question requires us to find the force acting on a thrown pebble at different stages of its motion. Given in the question is the mass of the pebble, which is 0.05kg. We also know that the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 10 ms^(-2), as this is a constant on Earth. Step 2) The force acting on a body is calculated by multiplying its mass by the acceleration acting on it, as given by Newton's second law (Force = mass x acceleration). Thus, we apply this formula as: F = m x g. Step 3) To calculate the force during the pebble's upward motion, we plug in the given values into our equation, 0.05kg for m and 10 ms^(-2) for g. This gives us: F = 0.05 kg x 10 ms^(-2) = 0.5 N. Step 4) Note that the force is always acting downwards, meaning it is in the direction of the gravity, and this happens even when the pebble is moving upwards. Step 5) Similarly, for the downward motion of the pebble, the force continues to act downwards with the same magnitude, 0.5 N. This is because, in the absence of air resistance, the only force acting on the pebble during its flight is gravity. Step 6) If the pebble is thrown at an angle, it will now have a horizontal component of velocity in addition to the vertical component. At the highest point of the trajectory, the vertical velocity component is zero, but the horizontal component remains the same throughout the journey. However, as the force is solely due to gravity, the direction remains downwards and the magnitude stays as 0.5 N. The horizontal velocity doesn\u2019t influence the force.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Note down the mass of the stone which is given as 0.1 kg. This is the known quantity provided by the problem. Step 2) For part (a), identify the acceleration due to gravity which is typically 10 m/s^2. This normal force means that there is a 'pull' towards the center of the earth. Step 3) Use the formula for calculating force F = mg. Replacing m and g with 0.1 kg and 10 m/s^2 respectively, to obtain F=1.0 N. This is the net force on the stone acting in the downward direction since gravity acts vertically downwards. Step 4) For part (b), understand that the train is moving at a constant velocity, which means the acceleration is zero. As the train doesn't accelerate, there is no force acting on the stone due to the train's motion. Consequently, the only force is the same gravitational force calculated in part (a) which is 1.0 N.

The key physical principle at play here is Newton's second law, which tells us that force is equal to mass times acceleration (F = ma). We'll be using these basic equations of motion to calculate how long it takes for the body to stop under the influence of a retarding force. Step 2) The first information given in the problem is the force, which is a retarding force of 50 N. In physics, retarding means acting against, hence this force is negative. So, we'll take our force F to be -50 N. Step 3) The second thing we have is the mass of the body, which is given as 20 kg. We'll denote this as 'm'. Step 4) We also know that the body eventually stops, which means that its final velocity 'v' becomes 0 m/s. Its initial velocity 'u' was 15 m/s. Step 5) Using Newton's Second Law (F=ma), we can determine the body's acceleration by rearranging this formula to get a = F/m. Plugging in the numbers gives us a = -50/20 = \u2013 2.5 ms^(-2). Here it is negative because it's a retarding force. Step 6) Now we use the equation of motion, v = u + at. We can rearrange this formula to solve for 't', the time, which gives us the equation t = (v-u)/a. Step 7) Finally we substitute the known values into this equation. This gives us t = (0-15)/(-2.5) which simplifies to t = 6 seconds. This is the time it takes for the body to stop under the given conditions.",

        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass, m = 3.0 Kg\r\nu = 2.0 m/s\r\nv = 3.5 m/s\r\nt = 25 s\r\nF = ma\r\nF = m [(v-u)/t] (since a = (v -u)/t )\r\nF = 3 [ (3.5 \u2013 2)/25] = 0.18 N\r\nThe force acts in the direction of motion of the body",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides certain values, including the mass of the body m=3.0 kg, the initial speed u=2.0 m/s, the final speed v=3.5 m/s, and the time taken for this change in speed t=25 s. These values are our known variables that need to be plugged into appropriate equations to find the solution. Step 2) We need to find the magnitude and direction of the force. To do this, we use the fundamental concept of mechanics that Force F equals mass m times acceleration a (F=ma). Our task is to find the value of the force F. Step 3) We don't have the acceleration 'a' directly given in the problem. However, we know that acceleration is the change in velocity over time (a = (v -u)/t ). We substitute this definition of acceleration into our force formula. Doing so, we get F = m [(v-u)/t]. Step 4) Next, we plug in our known values into this formula. This equates to F = 3 [ (3.5 \u2013 2)/25], which gives the magnitude of the force as 0.18 Newton (N). Step 5) The direction of the force will be in the same direction as the change in velocity because force causes an object to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Given that the direction of the motion of the body remains unchanged, it is justified to conclude that the force acts in the direction of the motion of the body.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We identify the known variables: mass m=3 kg, initial speed u=2 m/s, final speed v=3.5 m/s, and time t=25 s. Step 2) We identify the need to use the formula of force F=ma to find the magnitude and direction of the force. Step 3) Since we don't have the value of 'a', we replace it with (v -u)/t in the force equation as acceleration is defined as the change in velocity over time. Our formula now becomes F = m [(v-u)/t].  Step 4) We substitute our known values into this equation to get F = 3 [ (3.5 \u2013 2)/25], resulting in the magnitude of the force as 0.18 N. Step 5) Because force is linked to the change in velocity and the direction of motion of the body is constant as per the problem statement, we infer that the force acts in the direction of the body's motion."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides us with known values for the mass of the body (m=5 kg) and the magnitudes of two perpendicular forces acting on the body (F1=8N and F2=6N). Step 2) Remember from Newton's second law of motion that the acceleration of the body will be determined by the resultant force acting on it divided by the mass of the body. We know that the resultant force when two forces are acting at right angles to each other is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem: F = sqrt(F1^2 + F2^2). In our case, this results in F = sqrt(8^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(64 + 36) = 10N. Step 3) Now, we can find the acceleration a = F/m = 10N/5kg = 2 m/s, in the direction of the resultant force. Step 4) The angle of the resultant force with respect to the horizontal can be calculated using the definition of the tangent function. The direction of acceleration will be the same as that of the resultant force and can be calculated as tan \u03b2 = F2/F1 = 6N/8N = 0.75. Doing the inverse tangent calculation, we get \u03b2 = tan-1 (0.75) = 37 degrees. So, the acceleration is 2m/s directed at 37 degrees relative to the force of 8N.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Note the known values for mass and the two perpendicular forces provided in the problem. Step 2) We combine the two perpendicular forces to get the resultant force using Pythagoras' theorem, as the forces are at right angles to each other.

Divide the resultant force by the mass of the body to get the acceleration and note it's in the direction of the resultant force. Step 4) Calculate the direction of the resultant force (and hence the acceleration). This is done by taking the punch level of the forces (which are at right angles), calculating the tangent of the angle relative to one of the forces and taking the inverse tangent to get the direction in degrees."

        "Question": "8. The driver of a three-wheeler moving at a speed of 36 km/h sees a child standing in the middle of the road and brings his vehicle to rest in 4.0 s just in time to save the child. What is the average retarding force on the vehicle? The mass of the three-wheeler is 400 kg, and the mass of the driver is 65 kg.\r\n",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify all given values: u (initial velocity) = 36 km/h, v (final velocity) = 0, m1 (mass of the three-wheeler) = 400 Kg, m2 (mass of the driver) = 65 Kg, t (time taken to bring the vehicle to rest) = 4.0 seconds. These values are required to determine the retarding force. Step 2) Convert the initial velocity from km/h to m/s to maintain coherence in units. This is done due to the metric system, where units should match when performing calculations. Since 1 km/h is equivalent to approximately 0.278 m/s, we multiply 36 km/h by 0.278, which equals 10 m/s. Step 3) Calculate the acceleration, noted as 'a'. We use the equation a = (v - u)/t, which represents the rate at which an object changes its velocity. Substituting the given values gives a = (0 - 10) /4 = -2.5 m/s^2.  The negative sign indicates a deceleration or slowing down. Step 4) Solve for the total force 'F', which is the sum of the forces on both the three-wheeler and the driver, using F = (m1 + m2)*a.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's identify the known values. We are given the mass of the body as 0.40 kg, its initial velocity (North) as 10 m/s, and a force of 8.0 N acting against this direction (South) for 30 s. We're measuring position from the point the force is applied (t = 0, x = 0), and we're asked to predict the body's position at t = -5 s, 25 s, and 100 s. Step 2) Let's utilize the equation of motion, S = ut + 0.5at^2, where S is position, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Step 3) For t = - 5 s, before the force is applied, the acceleration is 0. So our equation becomes S= 10*(-5) + 0.5*0*(-5)^2, giving us a position of -50m. Step 4) At t = 25 s, the force is acting. We calculate acceleration a = F/m = -8 / 0.4 = -20 m/s^(-2), taking the negative sign since the force is opposite to the initial direction. Thus, S becomes 10*25 + 0.5*(-20)*(25)^2, meaning the position at 25s is \u20136000 m. Step 5) Then, at t = 100 s, the force acts only for the first 30 s, slowing down the body. We calculate the distance covered in these 30s by the above equation, getting S = 10*30 + 0.5*-20*30^2, or S = \u20138700 m. After 30s, the body moves at a constant speed, which we find using v = u + at => 10 - 20*30 = -590 m/s. The distance in the next 70s is -590*70 + 0.5*0*70^2, or \u201341300 m.

        "Original Solution": "Initial velocity, u = 0\r\nAcceleration, a = 2 ms^(-2),\r\nt=10 s\r\nUsing equation, v = u + at, we get\r\nv = 0 + 2 x 10 = 20 m/s\r\nThe final velocity, v = 20 m/s\r\nAt time, t = 11 sec, the horizontal component of the velocity in the absence of the air resistance remains unchanged\r\nVx =20 m/s\r\nThe vertical component of the velocity is given by the equation\r\nVy = u + ayt\r\nHere t = 11 \u2013 10 = 1s and ay= a = 10 m/s\r\nTherefore, the resultant velocity v of the stone is\r\nv = ( vx2 + vy2)^0.5\r\nv = (20 2 + 10 2)^0.5\r\nv = 22.36 m/s\r\ntan \u03b8 = vy/vx = 10/20 = 0.5\r\n\u03b8 = tan^(-1) (0.5 ) = 26. 56 degrees from the horizontal\r\n(b) When the stone is dropped from the truck, the horizontal force on the stone is zero. The only acceleration of the stone is that due to gravity which is equal to 10 m/s^2 and it acts vertically downwards.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start off with what we know. The truck starts from rest, which means its initial velocity (u) is 0. It then accelerates uniformly at a rate of 2 ms^(-2) (acceleration, a), and this continues for 10 seconds (time, t). Step 2) Using the equation of motion, v = u + at, where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration and t is time, we substitute our values in. This equation is used to find the final velocity after a certain time under constant acceleration. Step 3) We get v = 0 + 2 x 10 = 20 m/s. So, when the stone is being dropped, the truck's velocity is 20 m/s. This is the initial horizontal velocity of the stone once it's dropped. Step 4) After the stone is dropped, its vertical motion is independent of its horizontal motion. So for the vertical component of velocity, we use the equation Vy = u + ayt, with time, t = 11 \u2013 10 = 1s and acceleration due to gravity, ay= a = 10 m/s. Step 5) Using Pythagoras theorem, we calculate the resultant velocity v of the stone using v = ( vx2 + vy2)^0.5 where vx and vy are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively. This gives us v = (20 2 + 10 2)^0.5 = 22.36 m/s. This is the magnitude of the stone's velocity at t=11s. Step 6) To know the direction of this velocity, we can use basic trigonometry. tan \u03b8 = vy/vx = 10/20 = 0.5, where \u03b8 is the angle from the horizontal. We then find the angle itself with \u03b8 = tan^(-1) (0.5 ) = 26. 56 degrees. Step 7) Finally, we answer the second part of the question, which is about the stone's acceleration at t = 11s. After it's dropped, the horizontal force on the stone is zero, because gravity is the only force acting on it. So, its acceleration is only due to gravity, which is 10 m/s^2 and it's acting vertically downwards.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Set the initial conditions: initial velocity (u) is 0, the truck's acceleration (a) is 2 ms^(-2), and time (t) is 10 seconds. Step 2) Use the equation of motion, v = u + at, to find the final velocity (v). Step 3) Calculate v using the given values which gives v = 20 m/s. This is the stone's horizontal velocity when dropped. Step 4) For the vertical velocity (Vy), use the equation Vy = u + ayt with time (t) being 1s and acceleration (ay) as 10 m/s. Step 5) Combine the horizontal and vertical velocities to find the overall velocity using Pythagorean theorem v = ( vx2 + vy2)^0.5. This gives v = 22.36 m/s. Step 6) Use trigonometry to find \u03b8 which represents the angle of velocity from the horizontal. tan \u03b8 = vy/vx gives \u03b8 = 26.56 degrees. Step 7) Lastly, note that at t=11s, the stone's acceleration is only due to gravity, which equals to 10 m/s^2 vertically downwards."

So, if the string is cut the bob will fall vertically downward under the force of its weight F = mg.\r\n(b) At its mean position the bob has a horizontal velocity. If the string is cut, the bob will behave like a projectile and will fall on the ground after taking a parabolic path.",

The known parameters are the mass of the bob (m = 0.1 kg), the length of the string (2 m), and the speed of the bob in its mean position (1 m/s). Step 2) The question then asks us to examine two different situations: a) when the string is cut at one of its extreme positions and b) when the string is cut at its mean position. Step 3) For part (a), at one of its extreme positions, we are aware that the bob's speed is zero since it momentarily comes to rest before changing direction. Hence, there is no horizontal or vertical component of velocity. Step 4) This lack of horizontal or vertical speed will cause the bob to simply fall straight downwards once the string is cut due to the force of gravity, and it can be illustrated as F = mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Step 5) Now, let us tackle part (b) of the question: when the bob is at its mean position. At this point, the bob has the greatest speed, which is entirely horizontal. Step 6) Therefore, if the string is cut at this position, the bob will have an initial horizontal velocity and no vertical velocity. Step 7) The bob will then behave as a projectile undergoing horizontal motion (due to its initial speed) and simultaneously falling downward due to gravity.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the known values. In this problem, the mass of the man (m) is given as 70 kg, the gravity (g) is provided to be 10 m/s^2, and the velocity or acceleration under different scenarios is also provided. Step 2) Understand that what the weighing machine measures in this scenario is the reaction or the apparent weight of the man in the lift. Step 3) In case (a) where the lift is moving upwards with a uniform speed of 10 m/s, the acceleration (a) becomes 0 because the speed is constant. Hence, to calculate the reading (R) on the weighing machine, the formula R = mg is used, which gives 70 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 700 N. Step 4) In case (b), where the lift is moving downwards with an acceleration of 5 m/s^(-2), we apply Newton's second law of motion. The equation of motion becomes R+mg = ma. To isolate R, we rearrange the equation as, R = m (g - a), and plug in the values to get R = 70 kg*(10 m/s^2 - 5 m/s^2) = 350 N. Step 5) In case (c), where the lift is moving upwards with an acceleration of 5 m/s^(-2), using the same Newton's law, the equation of motion is the same as in Step 4, but the weight increases instead of decreasing due to the upward acceleration. We calculate R = m (g + a), plug in the values to obtain R = 70 kg*(10 m/s^2 + 5 m/s^2) = 1050 N. Step 6) In case (d), where the lift is in freefall under gravity (that is acceleration becomes equal to the gravitational pull, a=g), the man is weightless. Hence, calculating with our equation from previous steps, R = m (g - a), it becomes R = 70 kg*(10 m/s^2 - 10 m/s^2) = 0. Because the acceleration exactly matches the force of gravity, the scale reads as 0, meaning the man is effectively weightless.",

Step 2) Understand the principle that the weighing machine measures the apparent weight. Step 3) Apply the formula for weight (R = mg) when the lift is moving at a consistent speed, which means no acceleration. Step 4) When the lift is accelerating downwards, use Newton's 2nd law of motion (R + mg = ma), rearrange terms to solve for R (R = m (g - a)), and calculate the reading on the scale. Step 5) Similarly, when the lift is accelerating upwards, still use Newton's law, but remember that acceleration increases the effective weight (R = m (g + a)), and calculate accordingly.

        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nSmaller mass, m1 = 8 kg\r\nLarger mass, m2 = 12 kg\r\nTension in the string = T\r\nThe heavier mass m2 will move downwards and the smaller mass m1 will move upwards.\r\nApplying Newton\u2019s second law,\r\nFor mass m1:\r\nT \u2013 m1g = m1a \u2014\u2013 (1)\r\nFor mass m2:\r\nm2g \u2013 T = m2a \u2014\u2014(2)\r\nAdd (1) and (2)\r\n(m2 \u2013 m1) g = (m1 + m2) a\r\na = (m2 \u2013 m1) g/ (m1 + m2)\r\n=[ (12 \u2013 8)/(12 + 8)] x 10 = (4 /20) x 10= 2m/s\r\nTherefore, acceleration of the mass is 2 m/s^2\r\nSubstituting this value of acceleration in equation (ii) we get\r\nm2g \u2013 T = m2a\r\nm2g \u2013 T = m2 [ (m2 \u2013 m1) g/ (m1 + m2) ]\r\n\r\n= 2m1m2g/(m1 + m2)\r\nT = 2 x 12 x 8 x 10/ (12 + 8)\r\nT = 96 N\r\nTherefore, the tension on the string is 96 N",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, let's establish what we know. We have two connected masses, with the smaller mass, m1, being equal to 8 kg, and the larger mass, m2, amounting to 12 kg. The tension in the string connecting these masses is T. When the masses are released, the larger mass m2 will move downwards and the smaller mass m1 will move upwards due to the differential in mass.\n \nStep 2) Newton\u2019s second law applies here, which is Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). Therefore, we form two equations involving the masses m1 and m2. For m1, the force exerted by tension T upwards is counteracted by the force of mass m1 moving downward due to gravity (m1*g), resulting in the equation T \u2013 m1g = m1a, or equation (1).\n \nStep 3) Similarly, for m2, the downward force due to gravity (m2*g) is counteracted by the tension T upward, resulting in the equation m2g \u2013 T = m2a, or equation (2).\n \nStep 4) Next, add equation (1) and equation (2). From this, we can develop a formula for acceleration a: (m2 \u2013 m1) g = (m1 + m2) a, which simplifies to a = (m2 \u2013 m1) g / (m1 + m2).\n \nStep 5) Now, substitute the values of m1, m2, and g (acceleration due to gravity, which we'll take as approximately 10 m/s^2) into the equation to compute the acceleration a. So a = [ (12 \u2013 8)/(12 + 8)] x 10 = 2 m/s^2.\n \nStep 6) Therefore, the acceleration of the masses is 2 m/s^2. Now calculate the Tension T. We already have the formula from Equation (2), m2g \u2013 T = m2a. Substituting m2, g and calculated a, we have m2g \u2013 T = 2m1m2g/(m1 + m2).\n \nStep 7) Rearranging that equation results in T = 2 x 12 x 8 x 10/ (12 + 8), which equals to 96 Newtons (N). Therefore, the tension on the string is 96 N.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values: m1 = 8kg, m2 = 12kg, and assume T for tension.\n \nStep 2) Recognize that as the masses move, m1 lifts while m2 descends due to the gravitational pull.\n \nStep 3) Apply Newton\u2019s second Law (F=ma) for m1 and m2 to form two equations.\n \nStep 4) Add these two equations to find an expression for acceleration a.\n \nStep 5) Input known values to calculate the acceleration as 2 m/s^2.\n \nStep 6) Substitute this acceleration into one of the Newton's law equations, which has been rearranged for T, to find the tension.\n \nStep 7) After substituting the needed values and solving, find that the tension is calculated to be 96 N."

        "Question": "17. A nucleus is at rest in the laboratory frame of reference. Show that if it disintegrates into two smaller nuclei, the products must move in opposite directions.",
        "Original Solution": "Let m1, m2 be the masses of the two daughter nuclei and v1,v2 be their respective velocities of the daughter nuclei. Let m be the mass of the parent nucleus.\r\nTotal linear momentum after disintegration = m1v1 +m2 v2.\r\nBefore disintegration, the nucleus is at rest. Therefore, its linear momentum before disintegration is zero.\r\nApplying the law of conservation of momentum,\r\nTotal linear momentum before disintegration = Total linear momentum after disintegration\r\n0 = m1v1 + m2v2\r\nv1=-m2v2/m1\r\nThe negative sign indicates v1 and v2 are in opposite directions.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In this problem, we are dealing with a parent nucleus, which is initially at rest, disintegrating into two smaller daughter nuclei. Since no other information is given, the mass of the parent nucleus is denoted as m. The masses of the two daughter nuclei are symbolised as m1 and m2, and the velocities they gain after the disintegration are respectively represented as v1 and v2. It should be noted that the vectors attached to these velocity variables signify the direction of motion for each daughter nucleus.\n\nStep 2) It is a fundamental law of physics that the total linear momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted on by an outside force; this is known as the Law of Conservation of Momentum.\n\nStep 3) Before the disintegration, the parent nucleus is at rest which means its velocity is zero and hence, linear momentum (which is the product of mass and velocity) is also zero.\n\nStep 4) After the disintegration, the linear momentum is the sum of the momenta of the two daughter nuclei, which would be m1v1 + m2v2.\n\nStep 5) According to the Law of Conservation of Momentum, the total linear momentum before the disintegration should equal to the total linear momentum after the disintegration. As a result, we have the equation 0 = m1v1 + m2v2.\n\nStep 6) Solving this equation gives us v1 = - m2v2/m1.\n\nStep 7) The negative sign before the m2v2/m1 ratio implies that v1 and v2 are in opposite directions. This is the consequence of the fact that they must have equal magnitude but opposite directions to ensure the total momentum remains zero, which confirms that the two daughter particles move in opposite directions after the disintegration.",

        "Question": "18. Two billiard balls, each of mass 0.05 kg, moving in opposite directions with speed 6 ms^(-1) collide and rebound with the same speed. What is the impulse imparted to each ball due to the other?",
        "Original Solution": "Mass of each ball = 0.05 kg\r\nInitial velocity of each ball = 6 m/s\r\nThe initial momentum of each ball before the collision\r\n= 0.05 x 6 = 0.3 kg m/s\r\nAfter the collision, the balls change in the direction of motion without a change in the magnitude of the velocity\r\nFinal momentum after collision of the first ball = \u2013 0.05 x 6 = \u2013 0.3 kg m/s\r\nFinal momentum after collision of the second ball = 0.3 kg m/s\r\nImpulse imparted to the first ball = (-0.3) \u2013 (0.3) = \u2013 0.6 kg m/s\r\nImpulse imparted to the second ball = (0.3) \u2013 (-0.3) = 0.6 kg m/s\r\nThe two impulses are opposite in direction.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with known values in the question, with the mass of each billiard ball being 0.05 kg and their initial speed in opposite directions identified as 6 m/s. \n\nStep 2) We can calculate the initial momentum of each ball before the collision using the basic momentum equation, which is P_initial = mass x velocity_initial. So, momentum of each ball initially = 0.05 kg x 6 m/s = 0.3 kg m/s. \n\nStep 3) After the collision, the direction of motion changes for each ball, but the magnitude of velocity (speed) remains the same as before. This means the subsequent (post-collision) momentum will have the same magnitude but an inverted sign, as it's moving in the opposite direction now. So, the final momentum of the first ball = -0.05 kg x 6 m/s = -0.3 kg m/s, and for the second ball = 0.3 kg m/s since its direction didn't change.\n\nStep 4) Now, the impulse imparted to each billiard ball is calculated by finding the difference between the final and initial momentum, according to the Impulse-Momentum theorem. The first ball goes from a positive to a negative direction, so we subtract the final momentum from the initial one, thus getting the impulse on the first ball of (-0.3 kg m/s) - (0.3 kg m/s) = -0.6 kg m/s. \n\nStep 5) Similarly, the impulse imparted on the second ball is the difference in momentum; however, this ball remained in the same direction before and after the collision, and hence, its impulse is calculated as (0.3 kg m/s) - (- 0.3 kg m/s) = 0.6 kg m/s. \n\nStep 6) In conclusion, the two impulses are of equal magnitude, but opposite in direction, reflecting the principle of conservation of momentum.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known quantities i.e., mass and initial velocity.\n\nStep 2) Compute the initial momentum of each ball using the momentum formula.\n\nStep 3) Post-collision, since the direction of motion undergoes a change, final momentum calculations will take into account the opposed direction.\n\nStep 4) Impulse is calculated by the difference between the final and initial momentum.\n\nStep 5) Apply these calculations distinctly to the two balls based on their direction of motion post-collision.\n\nStep 6) Ends with observing that the two impulses are of equal magnitude but in opposite directions, reflecting the principle of conservation of momentum."

        "Original Solution": "Mass of the shell, m = 0.020 kg\r\nMass of the gun, M = 100 Kg\r\nSpeed of the shell = 80 m/s\r\nThe initial velocity of the shell and the gun is zero. So, the initial momentum of the system is zero.\r\nApplying the law of conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is equal to the final momentum.\r\nSo,\r\n0 = mv \u2013 MV\r\nRecoil speed of the gun, v = mv/M\r\nv = (0.020 x 80)/100\r\nv = 0.016 m/s",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem involves a shell of mass 0.020 kg that is fired from a 100 kg gun with a speed of 80 m/s. These are the known values given in the problem. Step 2) Initially, both the gun and the shell are stationary. Thus, the initial momentum of the system, which is the sum of the momentum of the gun and the shell, is zero. This is because momentum, given by the product of mass and velocity, will be zero when the velocity is zero. Step 3) When the shell is fired, the system's momentum needs to remain unchanged due to the law of conservation of momentum. The final momentum of the system is given by the momentum of the shell (mass of shell times velocity of shell) minus the momentum of the gun (mass of gun times recoil speed of the gun), which must still equal to zero. Thus, we get the equation 0 = mv - MV, where m is the mass of the shell, v is the speed of the shell, M is the mass of the gun, and V is the recoil speed of the gun. Step 4) We can rearrange our equation to solve for the unknown variable we are interested in, which in this case is the recoil speed of the gun, V. We get V = mv/M. Step 5) At this point, we plug in the known values into our equation. Thus, V = (0.020 kg x 80 ms^(-1))/(100 kg). Step 6) Solving this expression, we find the recoil speed of the gun is 0.016 m/s. So, the gun moves backwards at a speed of 0.016 m/s as the shell is fired.",

Step 2) Understand that initially, the momentum of the system is zero as both gun and shell are stationary. Step 3) Apply the law of conservation of momentum. This leads to the equation 0 = mv - MV, since the momentum after firing is the momentum of the shell moving forward subtracted by the momentum of the gun recoiling backward.

What is the tension in the string? What is the maximum speed with which the stone can be whirled around if the string can withstand a maximum tension of 200 N?\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "Mass of the stone = 0.25 kg\r\nRadius, r = 1.5 m\r\nNumber of revolution in a second, n= 40/60 = (\u2154) rev/sec\r\nThe angular velocity, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0n = 2 x 3.14 x (\u2154)\r\nThe tension on the string provides the necessary centripetal force\r\nT = m\u03c92r\r\nT = 0.25 x 1.5 x [2 x 3.14 x (\u2154)]^2\r\n= 6.57 N\r\nMaximum tension on the string, Tmax= 200 N\r\nTmax= m(vmax)^2/r\r\n(vmax)^2 = (Tmax  x r)/m\r\n= ( 200 x 1.5)/0.25 = 1200\r\nvmax = 34. 6 m/s\r\nTherefore, the maximum speed of the stone is 34.64 m/s",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by listing the given values. We know that the mass of the stone is 0.25 kg, the radius at which it is swung is 1.5 m, and its rotational speed is 40 rev./min. These are known quantities that we can use when solving the problem. Step 2) Convert the rotational speed from rev./min to rev./sec by dividing the original rate by 60. This is because there are 60 seconds in a minute. This gives us 40/60 = (\u2154) rev/sec. The conversion is necessary because we will be working with equations that use SI units, which utilize seconds for time rather than minutes. Step 3) Comprehend that the circular motion of the stone is caused by the tension in the string, which acts as the centripetal force. Step 4) To compute this tension, we first need to find out the angular velocity of the stone. The angular velocity, \u03c9, is found by multiplying the revolution rate (\u03ce) by 2\u03c0. This is because there are 2\u03c0 radians in each revolution, so we get \u03ce = 2\u03c0 * (\u2154). Step 5) To compute the tension on the string, we use the formula T = m\u03c9^2r, which is derived from the formula for centripetal force F = m\u03c9^2r, which is equal to m*v^2/r where v is the speed and m is the mass. Here, T is the tension, m is the mass, \u03c9 is the angular velocity and r is the radius. This formula equates the centripetal force required to keep the object in circular motion to the tension on the string. Step 6) Substitute the known values from Step 1 and calculated values from Step 4 into the formula T = m\u03c9^2r, resulting in T = 0.25 x 1.5 x [2 x 3.14 x (\u2154)]^2. Solve this to get T = 6.57 N. This result represents the tension in the string due to the stone's motion. Step 7) We are also asked to find the maximum speed the stone can travel given a maximum tension of 200 N. Step 8) The maximum tension Tmax= 200 N can be related to the maximum speed vmax using the formula Tmax= m(vmax)^2/r, which simplifies from the same centripetal force equation but with vmax as the speed at the max tension. Step 9) Rearrange the equation from Step 8 to solve for vmax: (vmax)^2 = (Tmax  x r)/m, then substitute the known quantities to find (vmax)^2 = (200 x 1.5)/0.25. Take the square root to solve for vmax and find vmax = 34.64 m/s. Hence, the maximum speed the stone can be whirled around in the circle without breaking the string is 34.64 m/s.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Write down the given values: mass of the stone, radius of the circle, and the speed of the stone. Step 2) Convert the speed of the stone from rev./min to rev./sec for consistency with the SI units system. Step 3) Understand that the tension in the string equals the centripetal force required for the stone's circular motion. Step 4) Calculate the angular velocity by multiplying the revolution rate by 2\u03c0. Step 5) Use the formula T = m\u03c9^2r to calculate the tension in the string. Plug in the known values and the angular velocity obtained in Step 4 into the formula and find the tension. Step 6) To find the maximum speed the stone can travel, remember that the maximum tension corresponds to the maximum speed. Step 7) Use the expression Tmax= m(vmax)^2/r derived from the centripetal force equation to solve for vmax when Tmax = 200 N. Step 8) Rearrange the expression and substitute the known values to solve for vmax. The result of this is the maximum speed with which the stone can be whirled around without the string breaking."

        "Question": "23. Explain why\r\n(a) a horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space\r\n(b) passengers are thrown forward from their seats when a speeding bus stops suddenly\r\n(c) it is easier to pull a lawnmower than to push it\r\n(d) a cricketer moves his hands backwards while holding a catch",
        "Original Solution": "The horse pushes the ground with a certain force when it pulls the cart. By applying the third law of motion, the ground will exert an equal and opposite reaction force upon the feet of the horse. This causes the horse to move forward. In empty space, the horse will not experience a reaction force. Therefore, the horse cannot pull the cart in empty space.\r\nDue to inertia of motion. When a bus stops all of a sudden, the lower part of a person\u2019s body that is in contact with the seat comes to rest suddenly but the upper part will continue to be in motion. As a result, the person\u2019s upper half of the body is thrown forward in the direction of the motion of the bus.\r\nWhen the lawnmower is pulled, the vertical component of the applied force acts upwards. This reduces the effective weight of the lawnmower. When the lawn mower is pushed, the vertical component acts in the direction of the weight of the mower. Therefore, there is an increase in the weight of the mower. So, it is easier to pull a lawnmower than to push it.\r\nWhen the batsman hits the ball, the ball will have a large momentum. When he moves his hands backwards the time of impact is increased contact, so the force is reduced.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's analyze why a horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space. The major concept involved here is Newton's third law of motion which states 'for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction'. As a horse tries to pull a cart, it pushes the ground backward with a certain force. Due to Newton's third law, the ground exerts an equal and opposite force on the horse's feet propelling it forward. In empty space, there's no ground to push against, so no opposite force is generated to help the horse move forward, hence it could not pull a cart there.\n\nStep 2) Now let's consider why passengers are thrown forward from their seats when a speeding bus stops suddenly. This involves the concept of 'Inertia of Motion', a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion unless that state is changed by an external force. When the bus stops abruptly, the lower part of a person's body connected to the seat, halts, but the upper part wanting to continue its motion due to inertia, moves forwards. Resulting in a passenger being thrown forward.\n\nStep 3) Next, why it's easier to pull a lawnmower than to push it. When pulling a lawnmower, the vertical component of the force applied acts upward, lowering the effective weight of the lawnmower. On the contrary, while pushing, the vertical component of the force applied acts downward, increasing the mower's effective weight. Hence, it is easier to pull than to push a lawnmower.\n\nStep 4) Finally, let's understand the need for a cricketer to move his hands backward while catching a ball. The momentum of a cricket ball is significantly high when hit by a batsman. When the cricketer moves his hands backwards, the time of contact between the hands and the ball is increased. According to the Physics principle, force is inversely proportional to time (F = m*deltaV/deltaT), if contact time is increased, the force experienced decreases. This reduces the stinging effect while the cricketer catches the high momentum cricket ball.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Newton's third law of motion is involved while a horse pulls a cart. The horse applies force on the ground, and due to the law, the ground applies an equal and opposite force that moves the horse forward. In empty space, there's no such thing to exert the reaction force on, hence the horse can't move.\n\nStep 2) The principle of inertia applies when a bus stops suddenly. The lower part of passengers' bodies stop with the bus, but the upper part retains its forward motion due to inertia, causing passengers to be thrown forward.\n\nStep 3) When pulling a lawnmower, the vertical force component acts upward, reducing the effective weight of the lawnmower. Conversely, when pushing, the vertical force component acts downward, increasing the effective weight of the lawnmower.\n\nStep 4) A cricketer moves his hands backward while catching a ball to increase the contact time, hence decreasing the force exerted on his hands. This stems from the physics principle that force is inversely proportional to time."

As action and reaction are equal and opposite, therefore, the force of reaction, F = 32500 N. This force acts vertically upwards.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start this problem by identifying the known quantities. The mass of the helicopter is 1000 kg, the weight of the crew and passengers is 300 kg and the vertical acceleration is 15 ms^(-2). Gravitational acceleration, denoted as g, is 10 ms^(-2). These are the values provided and known to us. Step 2) We add up the mass of the helicopter and the weight of the crew and passengers to get the total mass of the system, denoted henceforth as mi. This is done using simple addition: 1000 kg + 300 kg = 1300 kg. Step 3) To find the force exerted on the floor by the crew and passengers (Part a of the question), we use Newton's second law of motion stated as F = ma where F is the force, m is the mass and a is the acceleration. However, we have to consider both the gravitational pull (mg) and the upward acceleration (ma). Therefore, the force equation becomes R - mg = ma where R is the total reaction and we rearrange to get R = m(g+a). Step 4) Inserting the mass of the passengers and crew (m = 300 kg) and given values of gravitational acceleration and the upward acceleration (g + a = 10 ms^(-2) + 15 ms^(-2)) into the equation from Step 3, we compute the value R = 300 x (10+15). This leads to a force of 7500 N. Step 5) For part (b) of the question, we compute the action of the rotor of the helicopter on the surrounding air. This should consider the total mass of the system, mi. So, we use a similar principle as we did in part (a), computing R' - mi*g = mi*a, equivalent to R' = mi*(g+a), where R' denotes the total rotor force. Replacing mi with the total mass of the system, 1300 kg, we get a force of 32500 N acting downwards. Step 6) For part (c), we consider Newton's third law which states that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, the force acting on the helicopter due to the surrounding air will be equal and opposite to the force exerted by the helicopter on the surrounding air, which is 32500 N, acting upwards.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Take note of the given values \u2013 mass of the helicopter (1000 kg), weight of crew and passengers (300 kg), and the acceleration (15 ms^-2), and the known gravitational acceleration (10 ms^-2). Step 2) Find total mass of the system by adding the mass of the helicopter to the weight of the crew and passengers. Step 3) Formulate the equation for the force exerted on the floor by the crew and passengers, taking into account the gravitational pull and the upward acceleration (Newton's second law of motion). Step 4) Insert the given values into the equation derived in Step 3 (mass and accelerations), compute the force. Step 5) Use the similar principle to compute the force exerted by the rotor on the surrounding air, taking into account the total mass of the system (helicopter plus crew and passengers). Step 6) Use Newton's third law (for every action, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction) to deduce that the force on the helicopter due to the surrounding air will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the value obtained in the previous step."

        "Original Solution": "Speed of water flowing, v= 15 m/s\r\nCross-sectional area of the tube, A= 10^(-2) m^2\r\nIn one second, the distance travelled is equal to the velocity v\r\nDensity of water, \u03c1 = 1000 kgm^(-3)\r\nMass of water hitting the wall per second = \u03c1 x A x v\r\n= 1000 kgm-3 x 10-2 m2 x 15 m/s = 150 kg/s\r\nForce exerted on the wall because of the impact of water = momentum loss of water per second\r\n= Mass x velocity\r\n= 150 kg/s x 15 m/s = 2250 N",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we state the known quantities: The speed of the water is given as v = 15 m/s, and the cross-sectional area of the tube is given as A = 10^(-2) m^2. Step 2) We note that the distance covered by the flowing water per second is its velocity (v). This is because speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit time, or in this case, per second. Step 3) Next, we know the density of water, \u03c1, to be 1000 kgm^(-3). This is a standard physical value. Step 4) We calculate the mass of the water hitting the wall per second by multiplying the density, cross-sectional area, and velocity. In physical terms, this is because mass is equivalent to density multiplied by volume, and the volume flow rate here is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the velocity. The answer comes out to be 150 kg/s. Step 5) Then, we apply the fundamental concept in physics where the force exerted on the wall due to the water flow is equivalent to the momentum loss of the water per second. This is based on Newton's Second Law, which states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied and is in the direction of the force. Step 6) So, we calculate the force by multiplying the mass of the water hitting the wall per second (that we found in step 4) by the velocity. The answer is 2250 N. This is the force exerted by the water on the wall.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known quantities: speed of water (v = 15 m/s) and cross-sectional area of the tube (A = 10^(-2) m^2). Step 2) Acknowledge that the water's distance traveled per second is equal to its velocity. Step 3) Recall the standard value for the density of water (\u03c1 = 1000 kgm^(-3)). Step 4) Find the mass of water impacting the wall each second by multiplying the density, area, and velocity. We use the physical understanding that mass equals density times volume, with volume flow rate being area times velocity. Step 5) Understand that the force on the wall from the water impact is the momentum change of the water each second, following Newton's Second Law. Step 6) Calculate the force, using the mass per second value found in step 4, and the velocity. This results in the final force exerted on the wall."

        "Question": "29. Ten one rupee coins are put on top of one another on a table. Each coin has a mass of m kg. Give the magnitude and direction of\r\n(a) the force on the 7th coin (counted from the bottom) due to all coins above it\r\n(b) the force on the 7th coin by the eighth coin \r\n(c) the reaction of the sixth coin on the seventh coin",
        "Original Solution": "(a) The force on the 7th coin is due to the weight of the three coins kept above it.\r\nWeight of one coin is mg. So the weight of three coins is 3mg\r\nForce exerted on the 7th coin is (3mg)N and the force acts vertically downwards.\r\n(b) The eighth coin is already under the weight of two coins above it and it has its own weight too. Hence, the force on the 7th coin due to the 8th coin will be the same as the force on the 7th coin by the three coins above it.\r\nTherefore, the force on the 7th coin by the 8th coin is (3mg)N and the force act vertically downwards.\r\n(c) The sixth coin is under the weight of four coins above it and experiences a downward force due to the four coins.\r\nThe total downward force on the 6th coin is 4mg\r\nApplying Newton\u2019s third law of motion, the 6th coin will exert a reaction force upwards. Therefore, the force exerted by the 6th coin on the 7th coin is equal to 4mg and acts in the upward direction.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify what the problem is asking you to find. The problem is asking us to compute the force on the 7th coin due to all the coins above it, due to the 8th coin, and the reaction of the 6th coin on the 7th. We are given that each coin has a mass of 'm' kg. Step 2) For part (a), we note that force due to gravity (weight) is given by the equation 'F = mg', where 'F' is the force, 'm' is the mass and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity. In this case, the force on the 7th coin will be due to the weight of three coins above it. Plugging numbers into the equation, we get a force of 3mg Newton. This force is acting in the vertically downward direction, due to gravity. Step 3) For part (b), we're asked the force exerted on the 7th coin due to the 8th coin. By the same logic as above, this coin is experiencing the weight of the coins above it, plus its own weight. Thus, this results in the same force - 3mg Newton - once again acting in the vertically downward direction. Step 4) For part (c), we're asked the reaction of the 6th coin on the 7th coin. Once again utilizing the weight equation 'F = mg', computing the weight of the four coins above the 6th coin yields a force of 4mg Newton. According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Consequently, the force that the 6th coin exerts on the 7th coin is equal and opposite to the force it is experiencing from the coins above it. Thus, the reaction is 4mg Newton acting in the upwards direction.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the problem and the terms it lays out, in this case, the mass of each coin and quantity to find. Step 2) For part (a), use the formula for weight F = mg to calculate the force from the three coins above the 7th coin leading to a force acting downwards of 3mg Newton. Step 3) For part (b), determine the force on the 7th coin exerted by the 8th coin. Given it has the same conditions as in part (a), it also results in a force of 3mg Newton facing downwards. Step 4) For part (c), calculate the force that the 6th coin experiences due to the four coins above using the weight formula to give us a force of 4mg Newton. Remembering Newton's third law, this corresponds to an equal upward reaction force on the 7th coin of 4mg Newton."

        "Question": "30. An aircraft executes a horizontal loop at a speed of 720 km/h with its wings banked at 15\u00b0. What is the radius of the loop?",
        "Original Solution": "The speed of the aircraft executing the horizontal loop = 720 km/h = 720 x (5/18) = 200 m/s\r\nThe angle of banking = 15\u00b0\r\ntan\u03b8= v2/rg , we have\r\nr = v2/g(tan\u03b8) = (200 x 200)/(10 x tan 150) = (200 x 200)/ (10 x 0.2679)= 14931 m",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given the speed of the aircraft as 720 km/h, the angle of banking as 15\u00b0, and we need to find the radius of the horizontal loop it executes. For any object in a circular motion, the speed, radius, and gravitational force obey a certain relationship, which will be used to solve this problem. Step 2) Due to the unit we need our answer in, we must first convert the speed from km/h to m/s. We do this using the conversion factor of 5/18. This gives us 720*(5/18) = 200 m/s. Step 3) Next, we need to apply the formula that relates the speed of the object, angle of banking and the radius. This formula is tan\u03b8= v2/rg where \u03b8 is the angle of banking, v is the speed of the object, r is the radius (what we're trying to find), and g is the acceleration due to gravity (which we know to be roughly 9.8 m/s^2 but is simplified to 10 m/s^2 for this problem). Step 4) We can rearrange this formula to find an expression for the radius. This gives us r= v2/g(tan\u03b8). Step 5) Lastly, inputting the known values gives us (200*200)/ (10*tan 15\u00b0). Taking the tan of 15\u00b0 gives us 0.2679, which plugs into the calculation to give us (200*200) / (10*0.2679), yielding a radius of almost 14931 meters. So, the aircraft executes a horizontal loop of nearly 14931 meters in radius.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Start by noting down the given values, that is the speed of the aircraft and the angle of banking and realize the need to find the radius of the loop the aircraft makes. Keep in mind an important formula for circular motion which relates speed, radius, gravitational force, and banking angle. Step 2) Convert the speed of the aircraft from km/h to m/s by using the relevant conversion factor. Step 3) Make use of the formula tan\u03b8= v2/rg for objects in circular motion with banking, where \u03b8 is the banking angle, v the speed, r the radius, and g the gravitational acceleration. Step 4) Rearrange the formula to solve for the radius: r= v2/g(tan\u03b8). Step 5) Substitute the known values into the formula and compute the result, which is the radius, approximately 14931 meters."

        "Question": "31. A train runs along an unbanked circular track of radius of 30 m at a speed of 54 km/h. The mass of the train is 10^6 kg. What provides the centripetal force required for this purpose the engine or the rails? What is the angle of banking required to prevent wearing out of the rail?",
        "Original Solution": "Radius of the track = 30 m\r\nVelocity of the train = 54 km/h = 54 x (5/18) = 15 m/s\r\nMass of the train = 10^6kg\r\nThe required centripetal force is provided by the force of lateral friction due to the rails on the wheels of the train\r\nThe angle of banking required to prevent wearing out of the rails\r\ntan\u03b8= v2/rg = (15 x 15)/ (30 x 10) = 0.75\r\n\u03b8 = tan^(-1) (0.75) = 37degrees",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem states that the train is running along an unbanked circular track of radius 30 m at a speed of 54 km/h. We note down these values. Step 2) We need to convert the velocity of the train from km/h to m/sec because the unit of radius is in meters. To do so, we multiply 54 km/h by the conversion factor (5/18) to get 15 m/s. Step 3) The mass of the train is given as 10^6 kg. Step 4) We are asked which force provides the centripetal force required for the train to continue on its path. The centripetal force is provided by the force of lateral friction between the train's wheels and the rails on the track. Step 5) We want to find the angle of banking required to prevent wear on the rails. The angle of banking is that which would eliminate the requirement for any sideways force between the wheels and the rails. This can be determined using the formula for banking angle, tan(\u03b8)= v^2/rg, where v is the velocity of the train, r is the radius of the circular track, and g is the gravitational acceleration constant (approximately 10 m/s^2). Step 6) Substituting our known values into this equation, we find that tan(\u03b8) = (15^2) / (30*10) = 0.75. Solving this equation, we find that \u03b8 = tan^(-1) (0.75) = 37 degrees. So, to prevent wearing out of the rails, the track should be banked at an angle of 37 degrees.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) The problem provides the radius of the track, the train's velocity, and the mass of the train. Step 2) We convert the given velocity from km/h to m/s to align with the units of the radius. Step 3) To resolve the first question of where the centripetal force comes from in this situation, we explain that it is provided by the lateral friction between the wheels and the train track rails. Step 4) To find the banking angle needed to prevent rail wear, we will use the formula for the banking angle tan(\u03b8)= v^2/rg, where v is velocity, r is the radius, and g is gravity. Step 5) We substitute these values into the equation to find the angle theta that will prevent rail wear. From using the inverse tangent function tan^(-1), we calculate the angle to be 37 degrees."

        "Question": "35. A block of mass 15 kg is placed on a long trolley. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the trolley is 0.18. The trolley accelerates from rest with 0.5 ms^(-2) for 20 s and then moves with uniform velocity. Discuss the motion of the block as viewed by (a) a stationary observer on the ground (b) an observer moving with the trolley.",
        "Original Solution": "Mass of the block = 15 kg\r\nCoefficient of static friction between the block and the trolley, p= 0.18\r\nAcceleration of the trolley = 0.5 m/s^2\r\n(a) Force experienced by block, F = ma = 15 x 0.5 = 7.5 N, this force acts in the direction of motion of the trolley\r\nForce of friction, Ff= p mg = 0.18 x 15 x 10 = 27 N\r\nForce experienced by the block will be less than the friction.

He forms a non-inertial frame in which Newton\u2019s laws of motion are not applicable. The trolley will be at rest for the observer moving with the trolley",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin by identifying one of the known values. The mass of the block is given as 15 kg. This is the object that we're analyzing throughout the problem. Step 2) In this same vein, we note other given values. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the trolley is provided as 0.18. This number tells us about the frictional forces the block experiences when it's sitting idle. Step 3) Furthermore, the acceleration of the trolley is given as 0.5 m/s^2. Acceleration refers to how the speed of the trolley changes over time, and in this case, it's an input for later calculations. Step 4) For part (a) of the problem, we need to compute the force experienced by the block. To do so, we use the formula F = ma, where 'F' denotes the force, 'm' refers to the mass of the block, and 'a' represents the acceleration of the trolley. Substituting the given values, we get that F = 15 kg * 0.5 m/s^2 = 7.5 N. This force acts in the same direction as the trolley motion. Step 5) We also calculate the force of friction using the formula Ff = mg, where 'Ff' stands for the force of friction, 'm' is the mass of the block, and 'g' is the gravitational force, commonly taken as 10 m/s^2. The computed frictional force is Ff = 0.18 * 15 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 27 N. Step 6) We then compare the two forces computed. The resulting force on the block is less than the friction force, which means that the block won't move in relation to the ground. Hence, for an observer stationed on the ground, the block appears stationary. Step 7) For part (b), we consider an observer moving with the trolley. In such a case, the observer is in a non-inertial frame and Newton\u2019s laws of motion do not apply since the observer is moving along with the trolley. Hence, the observer sees the trolley (and therefore, the block on it) as stationary.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the given values: mass of the block, coefficient of static friction, and acceleration of the trolley. Step 2) For an observer on the ground, compute the force experienced by the block using Newton's second law, F = ma, and substitute known values. Step 3) Calculate the frictional force using the formula Ff = \u03bcmg where \u03bc is the coefficient of static friction. Step 4) Compare the two obtained forces. Since the frictional force is more than the force on the block, the block remains stationary. Step 5) For an observer on the trolley, we're in a non-inertial frame of reference, which implies that Newton's laws of motion don't apply. Hence, the observer would see the block as stationary, given they're moving at the same velocity as the block."

        "Question": "37. A disc revolves with a speed of 33\u2153 rpm and has a radius of 15 cm. Two coins are placed at 4 cm and 14 cm away from the centre of the record. If the coefficient of friction between the coins and record is 0.15, which of the coins will revolve with the record?",
        "Original Solution": "Speed of revolution of the disc = 33 \u2153 rpm= 100/3 rpm= 100/ (3 x 60) rps = 5/9 rps\r\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0v = 2 x (22/7)x (5/9) = 220/63 rad/s\r\nThe coins revolve with the disc, the centripetal force is provided by the frictional force mv2/r \u2264 \u03bcmg \u2014\u2014\u2013(1)\r\nAs v = r\u03c9, equation (1) becomes mr\u03c92/r \u2264 \u03bcmg\r\nr \u2264 \u03bcg/\u03c9^2 = (0.15 x 10)/(220/63)^2 = 12 cm\r\nFor coin A, r = 4 cm\r\nThe condition (r\u2264 12) is satisfied for coin placed at 4cm, so coin A will revolve with the disc\r\nFor coin B, r = 14 cm\r\nThe condition (r\u2264 12) is not satisfied for the coin placed at 14cm, so coin B will not revolve with the disc.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, notice that the speed of revolution of the disc is given in revolutions per minute (rpm). Conversion of this speed to revolutions per second (rps) is crucial as most calculations in physics are done using SI units (seconds in this case). Therefore, multiply the given 33 \u2153 rpm by 1/60 to convert to rps, giving you 100/(3 x 60) = 5/9 revolutions per second. Step 2) The radial or angular speed (\u03c9) of the disc's motion is calculated using the formula for angular speed, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0v, where v is the speed in rps. Substituting 5/9 for v in the equation, you get \u03c9 = 2 * (22/7) * (5/9) which simplifies to 220/63 rad/s. Step 3) When the coins are revolving with the disc, the frictional force exerted on them provides the centripetal force for their circular motion according to the formula mv^2/r \u2264 \u03bcmg, equation (1). In this formula, m is the mass of the coin, v is the speed, r is the radius, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Step 4) Substituting the value for v, as v = r\u03c9, into equation (1), it simplifies to mr\u03c9^2/r \u2264 \u03bcmg. With further simplification, we find that r \u2264 \u03bcg/\u03c9^2. Substituting the given values into this equation yields r \u2264 (0.15 x 10)/(220/63)^2, which results to r \u2264 12 cm. This implies that the maximum radius at which the coin will remain in motion with the disc is 12 cm. Step 5) Finally, compare this value with the distance of your two coins from the center of the disc. For coin A, r = 4 cm and for coin B, r = 14 cm. Clearly, coin A, which is 4 cm away from the center, satisfies the condition (r \u2264 12), while coin B, which is 14 cm away, does not. So, coin A will revolve with the disc and coin B will not.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert the speed of the disc from revolutions per minute (rpm) to revolutions per second (rps) for simplicity in later calculations. Step 2) Compute for the angular speed of the disc's motion using the formula \u03c9 = 2\u03c0v, which involves the converted speed. Step 3) Use the frictional force which acts as the centripetal force for the coins' motion to derive a formula mv^2/r \u2264 \u03bcmg to describe the maximum allowed speed of the coins without slipping. Step 4) Substitute the relationship v = r\u03c9 into the formula from step 3 to simplify it to an equation in terms of the radius, r. Solve this equation to find the radius at which the force of friction can just provide the required centripetal force, given by r \u2264 \u03bcg/\u03c9^2. Step 5) Determine if the radius of each coin's position satisfies this inequality to find out which coin(s) will revolve with the disc."

You may have seen in a circus a motorcyclist driving in vertical loops inside a \u2018death well\u2019 (a hollow spherical chamber with holes, so the spectators can watch from outside). Explain clearly why the motorcyclist does not drop down when he is at the uppermost point, with no support from below. What is the minimum speed required at the uppermost position to perform a vertical loop if the radius of the chamber is 25 m?",
        "Original Solution": "When the motorcyclist is at the uppermost point of the death-well, the normal reaction R on the motorcyclist by the ceiling of the chamber acts downwards. His weight mg also acts downwards. The outward centrifugal force acting on the motorcyclist is balanced by these two forces.\r\nR + mg = mv^2/r \u2014\u2014\u2014(1)\r\nHere, v is the velocity of the motorcyclist\r\nm is the mass of the motorcyclist and the motorcycle\r\nBecause of the balance between the forces, the motorcyclist does not fall\r\nThe minimum speed required at the uppermost position to perform a vertical loop is given by the equation (1) when R = 0\r\nmg = m(Vmin)^2/r\r\n(Vmin)^2 = gr\r\nVmin = \u221a(10 x 25) = 15.8 m/s",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Imagine the scene where the motorcyclist is exactly at the top of the spherical chamber, here the motorcyclist experiences two forces. First, his weight (the force of gravity) is pulling him downwards and, second, the normal reaction (the force due to the contact of the motorcyclist with the ceiling of the chamber) is also acting downwards. This is crucial to understanding why he doesn't fall. Step 2) The centrifugal force is acting outwards, which is towards the center of the sphere. Thus, at the uppermost point, this force pulls the motorcyclist upwards, against gravity. Step 3) The balance of forces for the motorcyclist can be represented by the equation R + mg = mv^2/r, where R is the normal reaction, m is the mass of the motorcyclist, g is the acceleration due to gravity, v is the speed of the motorcyclist, and r is the radius of the chamber. Step 4) When the motorcyclist moves with a speed such that the normal reaction R becomes zero, he is just in contact with the chamber, but without any weight. This is the minimum speed required to stay at the top of the spherical chamber. Step 5) This situation can be mathematically represented by setting R = 0 in our balance of forces equation. Here, you get mg = m(Vmin)^2/r. Here, Vmin represents the minimum speed required for the motorcyclist. Step 6) We rearrange this equation to solve for Vmin, which gives us (Vmin)^2 = gr. Taking the square root of both sides, we have Vmin = \u221a(10 x 25) = 15.8 m/s, which is the minimum speed the motorcyclist must maintain in order to not fall on the uppermost position.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that at the top of the loop the motorcyclist experiences his weight and the normal reaction force both acting downwards. The centrifugal force generated due to the motion also acts upwards. Step 2) Recognize that these forces are balanced, represented by the equation R + mg = mv^2/r. Step 3) Realize that the minimum speed at the topmost point is when the normal reaction becomes zero. Step 4) Represent this situation mathematically by setting R = 0 in our equation to get mg = m(Vmin)^2/r. Step 5) Rearrange this equation to solve for Vmin, which leads us to (Vmin)^2 = gr, taking square root gives the minimum speed."

        "Question": "39. A 70 kg man stands in contact against the inner wall of a hollow cylindrical drum of radius 3 m rotating about its vertical axis with 200 rev/min. The coefficient of friction between the wall and his clothing is 0.15. What is the minimum rotational speed of the cylinder to enable the man to remain stuck to the wall (without falling) when the floor is suddenly removed?",
        "Original Solution": "Mass of the man, m = 70 kg\r\nRadius of the drum, r = 3 m\r\nCoefficient of friction between the wall and his clothing, \u03bc = 0.15\r\nNumber of revolution of hollow cylindrical drum = 200 rev/min= 200/60 = 10/3 rev/s\r\nThe centripetal force required is provided by the normal N of the wall on the man\r\nN = mv^2/R = m\u03c9^2R\r\nWhen the floor revolves, the man sticks to the wall of the drum.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by noting down the quantities given in the problem. The mass of the man is 70 kg, the radius of the drum is 3 m, and the coefficient of friction between the man's clothes and the wall is 0.15. The cylinder is initially rotating at 200 rev/min. \n\n  Step 2) Convert the given rotation speed of the cylinder from rev/min to rev/s. We do this by dividing by 60 since there are 60 seconds in a minute. This gives us a speed of 10/3 rev/s. \n\n  Step 3) We should recognize that the force keeping the man in place against the wall as the floor is removed is the centripetal or 'center-seeking' force, which causes an object moving in a circular path to constantly accelerate towards the center of the circle. This force is given by the equation m\u03c9^2R, where m is the mass of the object, \u03c9 is the angular velocity in rad/s, and R is the radius of the circle. \n\n  Step 4) When the floor of the drum is removed, the man still won't fall as long as his weight (mg) is equal to or less than the frictional force pulling him up. The maximum amount of frictional force (fe) that can occur is equal to the product of the normal force (N) and the static friction coefficient (\u03bc), or fe = \u03bcN. \n\n  Step 5) Because the man is not falling, we know that his weight cannot exceed the limiting frictional force. In terms of the centripetal force equation from Step 3 and the frictional force equation from Step 4, this gives us the inequality mg \u2264 \u03bcm\u03c9^2R.\n\n  Step 6) We can now solve the inequality for \u03c9, the angular velocity. We first cancel the mass from both sides to get g \u2264 \u03bc\u03c9^2R. Then, we divide both sides by \u03bc and R to get \u03c9^2 \u2265 g/(\u03bcR). Taking the square root of both sides, and noting that we want the minimum \u03c9 for which the inequality holds, we find that \u03c9 must be equal to or greater than the square root of g/(\u03bcR), or \u03c9 \u2265 \u221a(g/(\u03bcR)).\n\n  Step 7) Plugging in the given values, we find that the minimum \u03c9 = \u221a(10/(0.15 x 3)) \u2248 4.7 rad/s.

        "Question": "1.The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand. State carefully if the following quantities are positive or negative.\r\n(a) Work done by a man in lifting a bucket out of a well by means of a rope tied to the bucket.(b) Work done by the gravitational force in the above case.(c) Work done by friction on a body sliding down an inclined plane.(d) Work done by an applied force on a body moving on a rough horizontal plane with uniformvelocity.(e) Work done by the resistive force of air on a vibrating pendulum in bringing it to rest.\r\n",
        "Original Solution": "(a) It is clear that the direction of both the force and the displacement is the same and thus, the work done on it is positive.\r\n(b) It can be noted that the displacement of the object is in an upward direction, whereas the force due to gravity is in a downward direction. Hence, the work done is negative.\r\n(c) It can be observed that the direction of motion of the object is opposite to the direction of the frictional force. So, the work done is negative.\r\n(d) The object which is moving in a rough horizontal plane faces the frictional force, which is opposite to the direction of the motion. To maintain a uniform velocity, a uniform force is applied to the object. So, the motion of the object and the applied force are in the same direction. Thus, the work done is positive.\r\n(e) It is noted that the direction of the bob and the resistive force of air which is acting on it are in opposite directions. Thus, the work done is negative.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by understanding the concept of work. In physics, work is a measure of energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved by an applied force along a displacement. The sign of work (positive or negative) is determined by the direction of both the force applied and the direction of the displacement. If they are in the same direction, the work is positive. If they are in opposite directions, the work is negative. Step 2) For the first case (a), analyze the directions involved. The man applies force to lift the bucket upwards, while the bucket also moves upwards. Hence, the force and displacement are in the same direction. By our definition from step 1, the work done here is positive. Step 3) Now, consider the second case (b). The displacement of the bucket is still upwards, but the force of gravity always pulls objects downwards, meaning the force and displacement are in opposite directions. Thus, according to our definition, the work done by the gravitational force would be negative. Step 4) In the third case (c), the frictional force acts opposite to the motion of the body on the inclined plane. Therefore, the direction of motion and the frictional force are opposite, making the work done negative. Step 5) In the fourth case (d), even though there is a frictional force that is opposite to the body\u2019s motion on the rough horizontal plane, an external force is being applied in the direction of the motion. This force exactly counteracts the friction, allowing the body to move with a uniform velocity. Therefore, the work done by the applied force (which is in the same direction as motion) is positive. Step 6) Lastly, in the fifth case (e), the resistance or drag force by air combatting the motion of the pendulum is in the opposite direction of the motion, resulting in negative work.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Define the concept of work and its sign, which depends on the direction of the force and the direction of the displacement. Step 2) For scenario (a), the force and the displacement are in the same direction, so the work done is positive. Step 3) In scenario (b), while the displacement of the object is upwards, gravity is always pulling it downwards in the opposite direction. Hence, the work done is negative. Step 4) In scenario (c), the body is sliding down an inclined plane while the direction of the frictional force is upwards. This means that work done is negative. Step 5) Scenario (d) sees the object moving with a uniform velocity on a rough plane, so even though there is a frictional force acting against the motion, an applied force is applied in the same direction as the motion, making the work done positive. Step 6) Finally, for scenario (e), air resistance acts against the pendulum's direction of motion, making the work done here negative."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the problem, we're given the following known values: the mass of the body (m = 2 kg), the horizontal force applied (F = 7 N), and the coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bc = 0.1).  We're also told the body was initially at rest, and that we want to calculate the work done after 10 seconds (t = 10 s). Step 2) For a body under force, acceleration is given by the Net Force divided by the mass of the body (a = F/m). Here, acceleration due to the applied force (a1) is F/m = 7/2 = 3.5 m/s^2. Step 3) The opposing force, friction, is given by the formula f = \u03bcmg, where m is the mass of the object and g (\u2248 9.8 m/s^2) is the acceleration due to gravity. Calculating this, we have f = \u03bcmg = 0.1 * 2 * 9.8. Step 4) The retardation due to this frictional force (a2) is -f/m, giving us a2 = -f/m = -196/2 = -0.98 m/s^2 - an opposing force, hence the negative sign. Step 5) The net acceleration (a) of the body is the sum of these two accelerations a1 and a2; therefore it's a = a1 + a2 = 3.5 - 0.98 = 2.52 m/s^2. Step 6) The next step is to calculate the distance moved by this body during the 10 seconds. This is given by formula s = ut + (1/2)at^2. Since the body is initially at rest u=0, hence the distance is s = (1/2)*a*t^2 = (1/2)*2.52*(10)^2 = 126 m. Step 7) Work done by the applied force in 10 s (a) is given by the formula work = Force x displacement, therefore it's 7 x 126 = 882 J. Step 8) Work done by the friction (b) is given by -f x s = -1.96 x 126, negative because it's an opposing force. Step 9) Work done by the net force (c) in 10 s is W = (F \u2013 f)s = (7 \u2013 1.96) * 126 = 635 J. Step 10) From equation of motion v = u + at, final velocity v after t=10 s is v = 0 + 2.52*10 = 25.2 m/s, since body was initially at rest. Step 11) Final kinetic energy (KE_f) will be (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)*2*(25.2)^2 = 635 J. Step 12) The body was initially at rest, so initial kinetic energy (KE_i) will equal (1/2)mu^2 = 0. Step 13) The change in kinetic energy (d) is the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy, KE_f - KE_i = 635 J - 0 = 635 J. The work done by the net force is equal to the final kinetic energy.",

Hence, the energy which is needed for the burning of the casing is obtained from the rocket.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we observe that the casing of the rocket is burning up because of friction. This means the rocket's mass is being reduced as the casing burns. Step 2) Now, we need to figure out the source of energy required for burning. For this, we refer to the law of conservation of energy, which tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another. Step 3) According to the law, the total energy of the rocket can be calculated as the sum of its kinetic energy and its potential energy. The equation for total energy is total_energy = mgh + (1/2)mv^2 where 'm' is mass, 'g' is gravitational force, 'h' is height, and 'v' is velocity. Step 4) When the rocket's casing burns up, there's a reduction in the rocket mass (m) which means there's a reduction in both kinetic and potential energy. This implies that there is a drop in the rocket's total energy. Step 5) Finally, since energy must be conserved as per our law of energy conservation, the lost total energy of the rocket is then used or converted to produce the energy required for burning. Hence, the energy required for burning the casing is obtained from the rocket itself.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify that the rocket's casing burning due to friction results in reduction of rocket's mass.

Step 4) Note that the drop in the rocket's mass leads to a decrease in its total energy. Step 5) Conclude that the 'lost' energy from the rocket must be what's utilized for the casing to burn as per the conservation law. Hence, the energy is obtained from the rocket itself."

        "Question": "Comets move around the sun in highly elliptical orbits. The gravitational force on the comet due to the sun is not normal to the comet\u2019s velocity in general. Yet the work done by the gravitational force over every complete orbit of the comet is zero. Why?",
        "Original Solution": "The force due to gravity is a conservative force. The work done on a closed path by the conservative force is zero. Hence, for every complete orbit of the comet, the work done by the gravitational force is zero.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand the question. It is asked why the sun\u2019s gravitational force does not work on the comet over a complete orbit. You have to remember that in any celestial body's movement around the sun, the gravitational force that the sun applies on that body is not perpendicular to the body\u2019s velocity, in fact, it is rarely so. Yet, despite this fact, the work done by this force over an entire orbit is zero. Here, the concept of 'work' in physics is being applied, where work is calculated by the force applied on an object and the distance that object moves due to that force. Step 2) Recall the definition of conservative forces, which are forces whose work done does not depend on the path taken but only on the initial and final positions. Some examples of conservative forces include gravitational force, electrostatic force, and spring force. They have this unique characteristic where the net work done by them over a closed path, which means a path that starts and ends at the same position, is zero. This is primarily due to the fact that the total energy of a system remains conserved. Step 3) Apply this definition to our comet-sun problem. Since the force due to gravity is a conservative force, and the comet's path is a full orbit that ends where it started, the work done by the gravitational force over the entire orbit is zero. This is even though the gravitational force is not normal to the comet's velocity. This conclusion is derived from the fundamental properties of conservative forces, not individual calculations.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Apply the concept of 'work' in physics and understand the path of a celestial body in orbit around the Sun. Step 2) Recall that a conservative force does work based on the initial and final positions, not the path, and that the work done over a closed path is zero because total energy is conserved. Some examples of conservative forces are gravitational force, electrostatic force, and spring force. Step 3) Realize that the gravitational force between Sun and the comet is a conservative force. Hence, despite not being perpendicular to the comet's velocity, it does zero work over a full orbit (a closed path) according to properties of conservative forces."

        "Question": "An artificial satellite orbiting the earth in a very thin atmosphere loses its energy gradually due to dissipation against atmospheric resistance, however small. Why, then, does its speed increase progressively as it comes closer and closer to the earth? ",
        "Original Solution": "The potential energy of the satellite revolving around the Earth decreases as it approaches the Earth, and since the system\u2019s total energy should remain constant, the kinetic energy increases. Thus, the satellite\u2019s velocity increases. In spite of this, the total energy of the system is reduced by a fraction due to atmospheric friction.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that an artificial satellite orbiting the earth resides in a system where energy remains constant. This means the sum of the kinetic and potential energies stay the same, even when displaced. This is the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. Step 2) Comprehend that as the satellite moves closer to Earth, its potential energy decreases. The potential energy of a satellite is given by the formula, PE = -GMm/r, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the Earth\u2019s mass, m is the satellite's mass, and r is the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite. As r decreases, PE decreases. Step 3) Recognize that due to the conservation of energy in the system, if potential energy decreases, then kinetic energy must increase to compensate. This is because the sum of the kinetic and potential energies must remain constant (given no external work is done). The kinetic energy (KE = 1/2 mV^2), is directly related to the satellite's speed. Thus, as the kinetic energy increases, the speed of the satellite also increases. Step 4) Understand that despite the spectral increase in kinetic energy and speed, the total energy of the system does decrease slightly due to the work done against atmospheric friction. This energy is not lost, but dissipated as thermal energy.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Acknowledge that a satellite exists in a system where the total energy remains constant. Step 2) Understand that as a satellite gets closer to the earth, its potential energy decreases due to the nature of the gravitational potential energy equation. Step 3) Take into account the energy's conservation rule and recognize that the decrease in potential energy would result in an increase in kinetic energy, and hence the speed of the satellite, to maintain the total energy's constant value. Step 4) Admit that the total energy of the system decreases slightly due to atmospheric friction which causes energy dissipation."

        "Question": "When a conservative force does positive work on a body, the potential energy of the body increases/decreases/remains unaltered.",
        "Original Solution": "Decreases\r\nWhen a body is displaced in the direction of the force, positive work is done on the body by the conservative force, due to which the body moves to the centre of force. Thus, the separation between the two decreases and the potential energy of the body decreases.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given a scenario where a conservative force does positive work on a body. Conservative forces include gravitational force, electric force, magnetic force among others. These are forces that do not dissipate the mechanical energy of a system but can transform it among various types. Step 2) When positive work is done by the conservative force, it means that the displacement of the body is in the direction of the force. This coincides with the standard definition of work done, which is force multiplied by displacement in the direction of the force. Due to this, the body moves toward the centre of the force. Step 3) As the body moves towards the centre of force, the separation between the body and the source of the force decreases. Potential energy is often associated with forces that have a 'centre' or source, such as the gravitational potential energy between the Earth and a mass located a certain distance away from the Earth's center. Step 4) With the reducing separation, the potential energy of the body decreases. This is attributed to the nature of conservative forces where they convert the potential energy of the body into kinetic energy (the energy due to motion) thereby decreasing the potential energy.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that we are given a scenario where a conservative force is doing positive work on a body. Step 2) Positive work being done implies that body is being displaced in the direction of the force, hence moving closer to the source of the force. Step 3) As body approaches the force centre, the potential energy associated with the body decreases due to the conservative nature of the force which is seen as converting potential energy to kinetic energy."

        "Original Solution": "Kinetic energy\r\nThe velocity of the body is reduced when the work done is in the direction opposite to that of friction. Thus, the kinetic energy decreases.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is stating the concept related to energy, particularly kinetic energy and work done against friction. When work is done against friction by a body, it means that energy is being used to overcome the forces of friction that tend to slow the body down or prevent it from moving. Step 2) The energy used to overcome friction decreases the body's kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of a body that it possesses due to its motion. It's given by the formula (1/2)mv^2 where m is the mass of the body and v is its velocity. Step 3) The amount of work done is directly proportional to the decrease in kinetic energy. Like if more work is done against friction, there would be a greater decrease in kinetic energy. Step 4) The energy loss due to friction is represented by the decrease in the body's velocity. This means that if the velocity of the body decreases, it means that more work has been done against friction and thus, more kinetic energy has been lost.",

        "Question": "The rate of change of total momentum of a many-particle system is proportional to the external force/sum of the internal forces on the system",
        "Original Solution": "External force\r\nChange in momentum cannot be produced by internal forces, irrespective of their directions. Thus, the change in total momentum is proportional to the external force on the system.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by acknowledging the context of the problem, which involves a many-particle system. A system like this has numerous particles which exert forces on each other. These are known as internal forces. The system might also experience forces from its environment, which are known as external forces. Step 2) The problem statement posits that the rate of change of total momentum of the system is proportional to the sum of the external force/sum of the internal forces on the system. This basically implies that the change in momentum (which can be calculated as final momentum minus initial momentum) relates in some way to the internal and external forces. Step 3) Our solution, however, focuses only on the external force. This might seem puzzling at first, why should we ignore the internal forces? Step 4) Here's the reason: The internal forces that particles apply on each other inside the system occur in pairs according to Newton's third law. These are also known as action-reaction force pairs. The net effect of these internal forces usually sums up to zero because the force exerted by one particle on another in the system is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the second particle on the first. Step 5) Thus, since the internal forces collectively don't bring any change in the system's total momentum, we can assert that any change in the momentum must indeed be due to the external forces. Therefore, the change in total momentum is proportional to the external force on the system. Hence, despite the apparent complexity of the many-particle system, we've realized that only the external forces truly matter in affecting the system's total momentum.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the premise: the system consists of many particles experiencing both internal and external forces. Step 2) Understand the problem statement: the rate of change in total momentum of the system is said to be proportional to the sum of external and internal forces. Step 3) Shift focus solely to external forces in the solution, seemingly ignoring internal forces. Step 4) Justification for this approach: internal forces occur in pairs and tend to cancel each other out, causing no net change to the system's total momentum, per Newton's third law. Step 5) Hence conclude favoring the effect of external force: in a many-particle system under consideration, the change in total momentum is proportional to the external force applied on the system."

Here, acceleration is assumed to be constant. \n\nStep 3) Now, according to calculus, we know that acceleration, 'a', is derivative of velocity, 'v', with respect to time, i.e., a = dv/dt. Since acceleration is stated to be constant here, it means the rate of change of velocity with time, i.e. dv/dt is constant. \n\nStep 4) Because dv/dt is constant, we can rearrange this as dv = dt x constant. This implies that the change in velocity is equal to time multiplied by a constant value.\n\nStep 5) To find the relationship between velocity and time, we integrate both sides of the equation to get velocity, v = \u03b1t, where \u03b1 is also a constant. Here, the implication is that velocity is directly proportional to time. We'll call this equation 1.\n\nStep 6) With these observations, we can determine an expression for power. Power (P) in physics is expressed as the dot product of force and velocity i.e., P = F.v.\n\nStep 7) We insert our earlier derived equations into this power equation.

Step 5) Solve for velocity by integrating, to find v = sqrt(2kt/m). Step 6) Substitute that equation into the definition of velocity as the rate of displacement over time (v = dx/dt). This results in the equation dx/dt = sqrt(2k/m) * t^(1/2). Step 7) Solve for displacement by integrating again, which gives you dx = k' * t^(1/2) dt where k' is a new constant defined as sqrt(2k/3).

The mass of the electron (me) is known to be 9.11 x 10^-31 kg, and the mass of the proton (mp) is given as 1.67 x 10^-27 kg. Additionally, the kinetic energies of the electron (Eke) and proton (Ekp) are provided, in kiloelectronvolts (keV). The electron's kinetic energy is 10 keV, and the proton's kinetic energy is 100 keV. Step 2) The next step is to convert these energies into joules (J) since the kinetic energy in the equation of motion is in Joules. This is done by multiplying the known values of energies by the conversion factor 1.60 x 10^-19 (since 1 eV = 1.60 x 10^-19 J). Therefore, Eke = 10 keV = 10 x 10^3 x 1.60 x 10^-19 J = 1.6 x 10^-15 J. And, Ekp = 100 keV = 100 x 10^3 x 1.60 x 10^-19 J = 1.6 x 10^-14 J.

The equation for kinetic energy E = 1/2 mv^2 can be rearranged to solve for velocity, v = sqrt(2E/m).

The height from which the raindrop falls, S, is given as 500 m. We know that the density of water, \u03c1, is 10^3 kg/ m^3. With these values, we can calculate the mass of the raindrop. Step 2) To calculate the mass, we use the formula m =(4/3)\u03c0r^3 x \u03c1. Plugging in the values from step 1, we obtain m = (4/3) x (22/7) x (2 x 10^(-3))^3 x 10^3 = 3.35 x 10^(-5) kg.

Step 4) The work done by gravity on the drop in the first half of the journey is found using the formula W = mg x s. Here, s is the distance over which the force is applied, which is half the total height of the journey, or 250 m. Doing the calculation, W = 3.35 x 10^(-5) x 9.8 x 250 = 0.082 J. Step 5) For the second half of the journey, we make the key insight that since the raindrop is moving at terminal speed (constant speed), the work done by gravity will be the same as that done in the first half of the journey. Therefore, the work done by gravity in the second half of the journey also equals 0.082 J.

We also know that the bob dissipates 5% of its initial energy to air resistance as it swings. Step 2) We calculate the potential energy of the bob at its highest point (when it's horizontal), using the equation for gravitational potential energy, which is m * g * h. Here 'm' is mass, 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity, and 'h' is height. Considering that the bob is at the maximum height which equals to the length of the pendulum (since it's swinging from a horizontal position), the potential energy can be written as m * g * l. Step 3) The bob loses 5% of its total energy to air resistance. This means that it retains 95% of its total energy, which is converted into kinetic energy at the lowermost point of its swing. Step 4) Use this information to form the equation for kinetic energy at the bottom point, which is 1/2 * m * v^2 = (95/100) * m * g * l. Here 'v' is the final speed of the bob. Notice that 'm' is present in both sides of the equation, so it can be canceled. Step 5) Simplify this equation to get an expression for v^2, which is v^2 = 2 * [(95/100) * g * l]. Step 6) Substitute values we know into this equation: plug in 9.8 m/s^2 for 'g' and 1.5 m for 'l'. This gives us v^2 = 2 * (13.965) = 27.93. Step 7) Solve for 'v' by taking the square root of both sides, yielding v = sqrt(27.93) = 5.28 m/s. So, the speed with which the bob arrives at the lowermost point is 5.28 m/s.",

        "Question": "19. A trolley of mass 300 kg carrying a sandbag of 25 kg is moving uniformly with a speed of 27 km/h on a frictionless track. After a while, the sand starts leaking out of a hole on the floor of the trolley at the rate of0.05 kg s^(\u20131). What is the speed of the trolley after the entire sandbag is empty?",
        "Original Solution": "The sandbag is placed in the trolley that moves with a uniform velocity of 27 km/h. There is no external force acting system. Even if the sand starts leaking out of the bag, there will not be any external force acting on the system. So, the speed of the trolley will not change. It will be equal to 27 km/h.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by acknowledging the given variables. The trolley has a mass of 300 kg and it carries a sandbag of 25 kg, thus total system mass is 325 kg. This system is moving at a speed of 27 km/h. The sand is leaking out of the bag at the rate of 0.05 kg s^(\u20131). The question is asking us to determine the speed of the trolley after all the sand from the sandbag has leaked out. Step 2) It's important to understand the key principle here, the conservation of linear momentum, which states that unless an external force acts upon it, the total momentum of an isolated system will remain constant. Step 3) Now, in our scenario, the action of the sand leaking out from the trolley can be seen as a small internal force within the system. As we have no external forces acting on this system (the trolley is moving uniformly on a frictionless track), the conservation of linear momentum principle applies. Step 4) Therefore, even as the sand leaks out, the total linear momentum before and after the sand has leaked out will remain the same (since the leaking sand is an internal force). Step 5) Lastly, it's important to remember that the speed of any object is directly related to its momentum. Therefore, even after the sandbag is emptied, the momentum (and thus speed) of the trolley remains the same. So, the trolley will continue to move at its original speed, 27 km/h.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given variables - initial speed of the trolley-sandbag system and the rate at which the sand is leaking. Step 2) Recall the principle of conservation of linear momentum which mandates the momentum of an isolated system, subjected to no external forces, remains constant. Step 3) Apply this principle to our given scenario, treating the sand leak as an internal force. Step 4) Understand that the total linear momentum of the trolley remains unchanged before and after the sandbag is emptied. Step 5) Conclude that the speed of the trolley remains as 27 km/h even after the entire sandbag is empty as the momentum hasn't changed."

It is important to note the mass as it will later be used to calculate the work done on the body by assessing the change in kinetic energy. Step 2) The problem then introduces the relationship between the body's velocity and its position. The velocity is equal to a times x to the power of 3/2, where a here is equal to 5 m^(-1/2) s^(-1). This relationship is specific to the motion of the body. Step 3) Now, determine the initial velocity of the mass at x = 0. It's given as v1 = a x 0, which calculates to 0 because any number multiplied by zero equals zero. Thus, at the starting point, the velocity of the body is zero. Step 4) Determine the final velocity at x = 2 m. By substituting this x value into velocity formula, v2 = a x (2)^(3/2), we find out exactly how fast the body is moving at x = 2 m which turns out to be 5 x (2)^(3/2). Step 5) The work done by the system is equal to the increase in the body's kinetic energy, since work is essentially energy transferred by a force. In this case, the energy is being transferred to the body and causing it to move. The increase in kinetic energy is calculated as 1/2 times m times ((v2)^2-(v1)^2). We get this by subtracting the initial kinetic energy from the final kinetic energy. Step 6) Start plugging the known values into the equation for the difference in kinetic energy.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, identify the known values from the problem. We know the area A of the windmill blades is 30 m^2, the wind's velocity v is 36 km/h, and the air density \u03c1 is 1.2 kg/m^3. We also know that 25% of the wind energy is converted to electrical energy. Step 2) Calculate the volume of wind passing through the windmill every second, which is the area A times the wind's velocity v, or Av. Step 3) From this, calculate the mass of air passing through the windmill each second by multiplying the volume of air Av by the air's density \u03c1, yielding \u03c1Av. For a time of t seconds, the mass passing through will be \u03c1Avt. Step 4) Next, compute the kinetic energy of the air, which according to the kinetic energy formula is 1/2 m v^2 where m is the mass and v is the velocity. Substituting the mass m = \u03c1Avt into the formula results in 1/2 \u03c1Avt v^2, and simplifying by combining like terms leaves us with 1/2 \u03c1Av^3t. Step 5) Now that we know the kinetic energy of the wind, we can calculate the electrical energy produced by multiplying the kinetic energy by the conversion factor of 25% (or 1/4). Doing so results in 1/4 * 1/2 \u03c1Av^3t, and simplifying this fraction to 1/8 \u03c1Av^3t gives us the electrical energy.

(b) Fat supplies 3.8 \u00d7 10^7J of energy per kilogram which is converted to mechanical energy with a 20% efficiency rate. How much fat will the dieter use up?\r\n",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In the problem, we are given a set of known values: the mass of the object the dieter is lifting (m=10kg), the height the object is lifted each time (h=0.5m), and the number of times the dieter lifts the object (n=1000). Step 2) We use these known values in the formula for work done against gravitational force, W = n(mgh). This formula arises from the basic physics concept that work is equal to force multiplied by distance. Here, the force is the gravitational force, which is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (g) - hence the term mgh. The total work is then this quantity multiplied by the number of times the object is lifted (n). Step 3) Plugging our known values into this formula, we do the arithmetic: 1000 times (10 kg multiplied by 9.8 m/s2 multiplied by 0.5 m) to get 49000J. Step 4) The problem also informs us that each kilogram of fat supplies 3.8 x 10^7J of energy which is converted to mechanical energy with a 20% efficiency rate. Therefore, the mechanical energy supplied by fat is 20% of this amount, which we calculate as 3.8 x 10^7 x 20/100 to get 0.76 x10^7 J/kg.

This amounts to P = 8 kW = 8000 W. Having the same units is important in order to correctly apply formulas and calculate the results. \n\nStep 2) Next, we know that the solar energy is incident at a rate of 200 W per square meter (W/m^2). This information tells us how much solar energy is received in a specific area.\n\nStep 3) We also know that 20% of this incident solar energy can be converted into useful electrical energy. This percentage is our efficiency factor which tells us how effectively we convert the inherent solar energy into usable power. \n\nStep 4) Now, to find the required area, we need to focus on how much useful electrical energy is produced per unit area per second. We can calculate this by multiplying the total solar energy received per unit area by the efficiency of the energy conversion.

The block of wood's mass m2 is 0.4 kg, and its initial speed u2 is 0. We also know that the final speed of the bullet and the block's combination is v m/s. Step 2) Apply the law of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the interaction (the parts moving independently) should equal the total momentum after the interaction (the parts moving together). So, m1u1 + m2u2 equals (m1 + m2)v.

So, the whole of the potential energy gets converted to heat energy.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) To begin solving, we note the known facts. The mass of the bolt, denoted by 'm', is 0.3 kg. The bolt falls from a height (h) of 3 meters which corresponds to the length of the elevator. \\n Step 2) We express the potential energy of the bolt. In physics, potential energy of an object in relation to height can be calculated using the formula Potential Energy = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational constant on Earth (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height from which the object fell. For this problem, we input the known values into the formula to calculate: 0.3 kg * 9.8 ms^-2 * 3 meters = 8.82 J. The calculated potential energy, 8.82 Joules, is how much energy the bolt possessed due to its height. \\n Step 3) Now we reason out the fact that the bolt does not rebound or bounce back up. This means all of the potential energy it had, due to its height, was converted into heat energy when it hit the floor. The heat produced from this energy conversion is thus equal to the calculated potential energy, 8.82 Joules. \\n Step 4) The last part of the problem is a conceptual question asking if our result would differ if the elevator was not moving. Since the acceleration due to gravity remains constant regardless of whether the elevator is stationary or moving (assuming the elevator is an inertial system), the potential energy of the bolt (and hence the heat produced when it hits the floor) would remain the same.

A child whose mass is 20 kg runs on the trolley with a speed of 4 m s^-1 from one end to another, which is 20 m. The speed is relative to the trolley in the direction opposite to its motion. Find the final speed of the trolley and the distance the trolley moved from the time the child began to run.",
        "Original Solution": "Mass m = 200 Kg\r\nSpeed v = 36 km/h = 10 m/s\r\nMass of boy = 20 Kg\r\nInitial momentum = (M + m)v\r\n= (200 +20) x 10\r\n= 2200 kg m/s\r\nFinal velocity of boy = M\\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}'\\end{array} \\) +m(\\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}'\\end{array} \\) \u2013 4 )\r\n= 200\\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}'\\end{array} \\) + 20\\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}'\\end{array} \\) \u2013 80\r\n= 220\\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}'\\end{array} \\) \u2013 80\r\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy,\r\nInitial momentum = final momentum\r\n2200 = 220\\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}'\\end{array} \\) \u2013 80\r\nLength l = 20 m/s\r\nt = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{20}{4}\\end{array} \\) = 5 s\r\nDistance moved by the trolley = \\(\\begin{array}{l}v{}\u201d\\end{array} \\) x t = 10.36 x 5 = 51.8 m",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify given values. The mass of the trolley (M) is 200 kg, its speed (v) is 36 km/h, which converts to 10 m/s for ease of calculation. The mass of the boy (m) is 20 kg. His speed relative to the trolley is 4 m/s, going in the opposite direction. The length the boy runs on the trolley is 20 m. \nStep 2) Calculate the initial momentum of the system. In this case, it is (M + m)v, or (200 kg + 20 kg) x 10 m/s, resulting in 2200 kg m/s. This represents the total momentum of the trolley plus the boy, before the boy starts to run.\nStep 3) Write an expression for the final momentum. The boy's final velocity relative to the ground is Mv' + m(v\u2019 - 4). This means that we first add the boy's speed relative to the trolley (4 m/s) to the trolley's speed v' to get the boy's speed relative to the ground. This gives us 200v' + 20v' - 80. Thus, the final momentum is 220v' - 80.\nStep 4) Apply the law of conservation of momentum, which says that the total momentum of a system remains constant unless external forces act on it. Because the underlying surface of the trolley is frictionless, and there is no other external force mentioned, the total momentum before the boy starts running equals the total momentum after. Thus, we equate the initial momentum to the final momentum: 2200 = 220v' - 80.\nStep 5) Solve this equation for v\u2019 to find the final speed of the trolley.\nStep 6) To find the distance the trolley moved while the boy was running, first calculate the time it took the boy to run the entire length of the trolley. Using the formula time = distance/speed, we get t = 20 m / 4 m/s = 5 s.\nStep 7) Then multiply this time by the speed of the trolley (v\u201d), to get the distance moved. Therefore, the distance = speed x time = 10.36 m/s x 5 s = 51.8 m.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values, including the masses and speeds of both the trolley and the boy. \nStep 2) Calculate the initial total momentum of the trolley-boy system, which is (mass of trolley + mass of boy) x speed of trolley.\nStep 3) Express the final momentum of the system in terms of the trolley's final speed (after the boy starts running), taking the boy's speed relative to the trolley into account.\nStep 4) Use the law of conservation of momentum to equate the initial and final momentum. This gives an equation in terms of the final trolley speed, v'. \nStep 5) Solve for v' to find the final speed of the trolley. \nStep 6) Calculate the amount of time it took for the boy to run the length of the trolley, using the boy's speed and the length of the trolley.\nStep 7) Multiply this time by the final speed of the trolley to find the total distance the trolley moved while the boy was running."

        "Question": "1. Give the location of the centre of mass of a (i) sphere, (ii) cylinder, (iii) ring, and (iv) cube, each of uniform mass density. Does the centre of mass of a body necessarily lie inside the body?",
        "Original Solution": "All the given structures are symmetric bodies having a very uniform mass density. Thus, for all the above bodies, their centre of mass will lie in their geometric centres.\r\nIt is not always necessary for a body\u2019s centre of mass to lie inside it; for example, the centre of mass of a circular ring is at its centre.\r\n",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We need to find the centre of mass for a sphere, cylinder, ring, and cube. Here, it is important to understand what the centre of mass means. The centre of mass is a precise point in an object around which its mass is equally balanced or distributed. This would be in the center of the object if its mass is uniformly dispersed everywhere. Step 2) Since the masses distributed in these given shapes (sphere, cylinder, ring, and cube) are uniform, their mass is uniformly spread out. Step 3) This means that the distribution of mass in each shape is symmetric. Therefore, we can conclude that the centre of mass for these symmetric items is in their respective geometric centres. Step 4) Moving on to whether the centre of mass of a body necessarily lies inside the body, it's important to recognize that this is not always the case. The location of the centre of mass is dependent on the distribution of matter within the body. As a concrete case, consider a hollow circular ring. The mass is uniformly distributed along its circumference, but there's no mass in its geometric centre. Yet the center of the circular ring, where no mass exists, is still its centre of mass. This is because the centre of mass accounts for the distribution of the mass within the object but does not necessarily coincide with physical matter.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the concept of centre of mass as a point where an object's mass is evenly spread out. Step 2) Note that the sphere, cylinder, ring, and cube have uniform mass which means the mass is evenly distributed. Step 3) Conclude that the centre of mass is at the geometric centre of these shapes because of the symmetric distribution of their mass. Step 4) Recognize that it is not always necessary for the centre of mass of a body to be located inside it, for instance, in a hollow circular ring, the centre of mass is at the geometric centre where there's no actual mass."

        "Question": "Q3. A child sits stationary at one end of a long trolley, moving uniformly with a speed V on a smooth horizontal floor. If the child gets up and runs about on the trolley in any manner, what is the speed of the CM of the (trolley + child) system?",
        "Original Solution": "The child and the trolley constitute a single system, and the child moving inside the trolley is a purely internal motion. Since there is no external force on the system, the velocity of the centre of mass of the system will not change.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, consider the whole system, which includes both the child and the trolley. These two entities together form a connected system that we are interested in studying. In physics, we often deal with such systems to simplify the problem. Here, the child sitting or running on the trolley doesn't impact anyone or anything outside of this system, meaning we can study the child and the trolley as a single object. Step 2) Within the system, any motion of the child is considered internal motion. This is because any action the child does, whether sitting stationary or running in any manner, only matters within our chosen system. The movement does not affect the things outside of the system. Hence, the movement of the child is purely internal. Step 3) Recall Newton's first law of motion \u2013 an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. There is no external force acting on the (child + trolley) system here. Step 4) Consequently, the velocity of the center of mass (CM) of our (child + trolley) system will not change. This is a direct consequence of no external force on the system. We can imagine, for example, that as the child moves forward on the trolley, the trolley in response moves a little in the other direction to maintain the same center of mass overall. This ensures that the center of mass of the system (child + trolley) maintains the same velocity V as before. Therefore, the speed of the CM of the (trolley + child) system remains the same, no matter how the child moves on the trolley.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that the child and the trolley together form a system. Step 2) The child's movement on the trolley is internal to this system, having no effect on anything outside of it. Step 3) There is no external force applied to this system, following from Newton's first law. Step 4) As a result, the center of mass of this system retains its original speed irrespective of the child's movement on the trolley."

        "Original Solution": "Linear momentum , \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\vec{p} = p_{x}\\hat{i} + p_{y}\\hat{j} + p_{z}\\hat{k}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\nPosition vector of the body , \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\nAngular momentum , \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\vec{I} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}(x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}) \\times (p_{x}\\hat{i} + p_{y}\\hat{j} + p_{z}\\hat{k})\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k}\\\\ x & y & z\\\\ p_{x}& p_{y} & p_{z} \\end{bmatrix}\\end{array} \\)=\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\hat{i}(yp_{z} -zp_{y}) +\\hat{j}( zp_{x} \u2013 xp_{z} ) + \\hat{k}(xp_{y} -yp_{x})\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\n \r\nFrom this, we can conclude\r\nlX = ypZ \u2013 zpyy ,  lY = zpX \u2013 xpZ and lZ = xpY \u2013 ypX\r\nIf the body only moves in the x-y plane, then z = pz = 0. Which means\r\nlX =  lY = 0\r\nHence, only lZ = xpY \u2013 ypX , which is just the z component of angular momentum.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is asking for the components of angular momentum along the x, y, and z axes. Angular momentum is calculated by the cross product between the position vector and the momentum of the particle. In the representation of vectors, we have the position vector r = x\u00ee + y\u0135 + zk\u0302 and the momentum vector p = px\u00ee + py\u0135 + pk\u0302. These are given by the problem statement.\nStep 2) To find the angular momentum, we need to find the cross product of the vectors r and p. This is done using the cross product formula for vectors in Cartesian coordinates. This results in the calculation: (x\u00ee + y\u0135 + zk\u0302) x (px\u00ee + py\u0135 + pk\u0302).\nStep 3) This cross product is further calculated using the determinant method in 3 dimensions. We set up this determinant with \u00ee, \u0135, k\u0302 on the top row, and the components of the vectors r and p in the second and third rows respectively.\nStep 4) Solving this determinant gives us our angular momentum components: \u00ee(yp - zpy) + \u0135(zpx \u2013 xpz) + k\u0302(xpy - ypx). Here each term corresponds to the x, y and z components of the angular momentum respectively.\nStep 5) From this result, we can write expressions for each component of the angular momentum: lX = ypz - zpy, lY = zpx - xpz, lZ = xpy - ypx.\nStep 6) Now we come to the second part of the problem which states that if the particle only moves in the x-y plane, then z and pz = 0 (as there is no movement in the z direction).\nStep 7) Substituting these values into the expressions for each angular momentum component, we find that both lX and lY become 0, as they both contain terms that multiply z or pz.\nStep 8) Therefore, we are only left with the z component of the angular momentum: lZ = xpy \u2013 ypx. This means that when the particle only moves in the x-y plane, the angular momentum has only a z-component.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin with the given momentum vector and position vector of the particle.\nStep 2) Compute the angular momentum by finding the cross product of the position vector and the momentum vector.\nStep 3) Calculate the cross product using the determinant method for vectors in three dimensions.\nStep 4) Solve the determinant to obtain the x, y, and z components of the angular momentum.\nStep 5) Extract individual expressions for each component of the angular momentum.\nStep 6) Apply the condition of movement only in the x-y plane, setting z and pz equal to zero to find the values of angular momentum components.\nStep 7) Substituting z=0 and pz=0 into the angular momentum equations yields that the x and y components are zero.\nStep 8) Hence, it indicates that only the z-component of angular momentum remains, reaffirming that for motion in the x-y plane, the angular momentum only has a z-component."

The cylinder is free to rotate about its standard axis of symmetry, and the sphere is free to rotate about an axis passing through its centre. Which of the two will acquire a greater angular speed after a given time?",
        "Original Solution": "Let m be the mass and r be the radius of the solid sphere and also the hollow cylinder.\r\nThe moment of inertia of the hollow cylinder about its standard axis, I1 = MR2\r\nMoment of inertia of the solid sphere about an axis passing through its centre\r\nI2 = (2MR^2 ) / 5\r\nLet T be the magnitude of the torque being exerted on the two structures, producing angular accelerations of   \u03b12 and \u03b11  in the sphere and the cylinder, respectively.\r\nThus, we have T =  I1\u03b11= I2\u03b12 \r\n\u2234 \u03b12 / \u03b11  =  I1  /  I2  =  \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{MR^{2}}{\\frac{2}{5}MR^{2}}\\end{array} \\) = 5/2\r\n\u03b12 > \u03b11          . . . . . .( 1 )\r\nNow, using the relation\r\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03b1t\r\nWhere,\r\n\u03c90 = Initial angular velocity\r\nt = Time of rotation\r\n\u03c9 = Final angular velocity\r\nFor equal \u03c90 and t, we have\r\n\u03c9 \u221d \u03b1             . . . . . . .  . ( 2 )\r\nFrom equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), we can write\r\n\u03c92 > \u03c91\r\nThus, from the above relation, it is clear that the angular velocity of the solid sphere will be greater than that of the hollow cylinder.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, let's define our known quantities. The mass, labelled as 'm', and the radius, labelled as 'r', of both the solid sphere and the hollow cylinder are the same. Also, let's set T as the magnitude of the torque being exerted on the two objects.\n Step 2) For rotational motion, the property that is quite similar to mass in linear motion is the moment of inertia. For the hollow cylinder, about its standard axis, the moment of inertia which we will call I1 is calculated by the formula 'MR^2', where M is the mass and R is the radius of the cylinder.\n Step 3) Similarly, we calculate the moment of inertia of the solid sphere about an axis passing through its centre, which we designate as I2 using the formula '(2MR^2 ) / 5'.\n Step 4) The torque applied to these structures causes an angular acceleration. Assume that \u03b12 and \u03b11 are the angular accelerations in the sphere and the cylinder, respectively. As the torques are equal, we can set up the equation 'T =  I1\u03b11= I2\u03b12'.\n Step 5) From this, we can derive a relation between the angular accelerations of the sphere and the cylinder: \u03b12 / \u03b11  =  I1  /  I2  = MR^2 / (2/5MR^2) = 5/2. This implies that the angular acceleration of the sphere (\u03b12) is greater than that of the cylinder (\u03b11).\n Step 6) Now, let's use the relation \u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03b1t, where \u03c90 is the initial angular velocity, t is the time of rotation, and \u03c9 is the final angular velocity. For equal initial angular velocities and the same time, the final angular velocity directly correlates with the angular acceleration, yielding \u03c9 \u221d \u03b1.\n Step 7) Given our previous results, we thus determine that \u03c92 > \u03c91, indicating that the angular velocity of the solid sphere will be greater than that of the hollow cylinder.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by identifying the known values. The initial angular speed \u03c91 is given as 40 rev/min. The child's moment of inertia is reduced to 2/5 its initial value when he folds his hands, so we'll call the initial moment of inertia I1 and the final moment of inertia I2. We can express I2 as (2/5)I1, according to the information given in the problem. Step 2) In the absence of external forces, the principle of conservation of angular momentum states that the initial and the final angular momentum of the system must be equal. We can express this condition mathematically as I1 \u03c91 = I2 \u03c92. Step 3) Here, we isolate the final angular speed \u03c92 on one side of the equation by dividing both sides by I2. The equation becomes \u03c92 = (I1/I2) \u03c91. Step 4) We substitute I2 = (2/5)I1 into the equation to find \u03c92 = (5/2) \u03c91. Replacing the known angular velocity from Step 1 \u03c91 = 40 rev/min gives \u03c92 = (5/2) \u00d7 40 = 100 rev/min. This is the new angular speed of the child when he folds his hands. Step 5) To assess the change in kinetic energy, we start by stating the formulas for the initial kinetic energy of rotation EI = (1/2)I1(\u03c91)^2 and the final kinetic energy of rotation EF = (1/2)I2(\u03c92)^2. Step 6) By dividing the equation for EF by the equation for EI, we can compare the initial and final kinetic energy. The result is EF / EI = (1/2)I2(\u03c92)^2 / (1/2)I1(\u03c91)^2, which simplifies to EF / EI = I2(\u03c92)^2 / I1(\u03c91)^2 since the 1/2 terms cancel out on each side. Step 7) Substituting our known values and ratios, we find EF / EI = (2/5)I1 (100)^2 / I1 (40)^2, which simplifies to EF / EI = 2.5. Step 8) Multiply both sides of the equation by EI to get EF = 2.5EI. This means the final kinetic energy of rotation is 2.5 times greater than the initial value. The increase in kinetic energy comes from the internal energy used by the child to contract his arms.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values including initial angular velocity \u03c91 and how the child's moment of inertia changes when he folds his hands.

        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass of the hollow cylinder, m = 3 kg\r\nRadius of the hollow cylinder, r = 40cm  = 0.4 m\r\nForce applied, F = 30 N\r\nMoment of inertia of the hollow cylinder about its  axis\r\nI = mr^2\r\n= 3 \u00d7 (0.4)^2 = 0.48 kg m^2\r\nTorque, T = F \u00d7 r  =  30 \u00d7 0.4  = 12 Nm\r\nAlso, we know that\r\nTorque = Moment of inertia x Acceleration\r\nT = I\u03b1\r\n( a ) Therefore, \u03b1 = T / I  =  12 / 0.48  = 25 rad s^-2\r\n( b ) Linear acceleration = R\u03b1 = 0.4 \u00d7 25 = 10 m s^\u20132 ",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given that the mass of the hollow cylinder, m, is 3 kg, and the radius, r, is 40 cm (or 0.4 m), with the force applied, F, being 30 N. These are our known values and will be used to calculate the angular acceleration and the linear acceleration later on. Step 2) We need to work out the moment of inertia (I), which for a hollow cylinder, is calculated as I = m*r^2. This equation allows us to account for the distribution of the cylinder's mass, based on the cylinder's mass and the square of its radius. When we plug our known values, we get I = 3*(0.4)^2 = 0.48 kg m^2. Step 3) Next, we need to determine the torque (T), which is the force that causes an object to rotate around an axis. We use the equation T = F * r. With our known values of 30N for the force and 0.4 m for the radius, we find T = 30*0.4 = 12 Nm. Step 4) We remember that Torque is also equal to Moment of Inertia times Angular Acceleration, i.e. T = I*\u03b1. With this, we can isolate \u03b1 to find the angular acceleration. \u03b1 = T/I = 12/0.48 = 25 rad s^-2. Step 5) Finally, we calculate the linear acceleration. We utilize the relationship between the linear acceleration (a) and the angular acceleration (\u03b1), which is a = R*\u03b1.  After plugging in the radius (0.4 m) and the angular acceleration (25 rad s^-2) we just calculated into this formula, we obtain a = 0.4*25 = 10 m s^-2.",

(Note: Uniform angular velocity in the absence of friction implies zero torque. In practice, applied torque is needed to counter frictional torque.) Assume that the engine is 100% efficient.",
        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nThe angular speed of the rotor, \u03c9 = 200 rad/s\r\nTorque, T = 180 Nm\r\nTherefore, the power of the rotor (P)\r\nP = T \u03c9\r\n= 200 \u00d7 180\r\n= 36.0 kW\r\nTherefore, the engine requires  36.0 kW of power.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the problem, we identify the given values. The angular speed of the rotor is 200 rad/s and the torque required to maintain this speed is 180 Nm. Step 2) To find the power required by the engine to maintain this torque, we will need to use the relation between power (P), torque (T), and angular speed (\u03c9), given by the formula P = T \u03c9. Step 3) In this formula T stands for torque and \u03c9 stands for the angular speed. To isolate the power on one side we merely state P, because it is already done for us in the equation. Step 4) Next, we will plug the known values into the equation. So that will be P = 180 Nm (the torque) times 200 rad/s (the angular speed). Step 5) We multiply the two values together, which gives us 36000. However, note that, the standard metric unit for power is watts (W), while the value we have obtained is in the order of 10^3; thus, power is conveniently expressed in kilowatts.

        "Original Solution": "The centre of mass of the meter rule shifts to 45 cm mark from 50 cm mark when 2 coins are added at 12 cm mark.\r\nMass of two coins, m = 10 g\r\nDistance at which the coins are placed from the new support d1= 45 \u2013 12 = 33 cm\r\nDistance of the centre of mass from the new support= 50- 45 = 5 cm\r\nTo find the mass of the scale, we should use the balancing moments.\r\nMoment due to the coins, r1 = m x d1\r\nMoment due to the mass of the scale r2 = M x d2\r\nr1 = r2\r\nm x d1 = M x d2\r\nSubstituting, we get\r\n10 x 33 = M x d2\r\nM = (10 x 33) /5 = 330/5 = 66 g",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Take note of the problem. You are told a metre stick is balanced on a knife edge at its centre. When two coins, each of mass 5 g are put one on top of the other at the 12.0 cm mark, the stick is found to be balanced at 45.0 cm. So the first thing you need to find is the weight of these two coins, which is 5 g each, hence in total, you have 10 g. Step 2) Next, calculate distance at which the coins are placed from the new support, defined as d1. The coins are at the 12 cm mark and the new balance point is at the 45 cm mark. So, d1= 45 \u2013 12 = 33 cm. Step 3) Calculate the distance of the centre of mass from the new support, defined as d2. The centre of mass originally was at the 50 cm mark, it has now shifted to the 45 cm mark, hence, d2 = 50 - 45 = 5 cm. Step 4) Now, we apply the principle of moments, which implies for the metre stick to be balanced, the moment due to the mass of the coins (r1) must be equal to the moment due to the mass of the stick itself (r2). This can be expressed mathematically as: 'r1 = m x d1' and 'r2 = M x d2'. By substituting the known values into these equations we find: Moment due to the coins, r1 = m x d1 = 10 g x 33 cm and Moment due to the mass of the scale (unknown yet), r2 = M x d2, which equals M x 5 cm. Since r1 = r2, we equate the two to find the mass of the stick (M). Step 5) After equating, you get: m x d1 = M x d2 which simplifies to 10 x 33 = M x 5. Solving this for M, (the mass of the stick) gives: M = (10 x 33) /5 = 330/5 = 66g. So, the mass of the metre stick is 66 g.",

Step 3) Calculate the distance d2 from the original balance point to the new one: d2 = 50 - 45 = 5 cm. Step 4) Apply the principle of moments to equalise the moment due to the coins (r1 = m x d1) and the moment due to the stick (r2 = M x d2). Step 5) Substitute the known values into r1 = r2 to derive the equation 10 x 33 = M x 5. Solve this equation for M to find that the mass of the stick, M, is 66 g."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by defining the problem. In this case, our problem involves a solid sphere rolling down two different inclined planes of equal height. We're asked to determine if the sphere will reach the bottom at the same speed, and also if it might take longer to roll down one plane than the other due to the difference in their angles of inclination. To tackle these questions, it's necessary to declare certain variables: let the mass of the sphere be 'm', the height of the incline be 'h', and the eventual velocity of the sphere at the bottom of the plane be 'v'.\n\nStep 2) Calculate the potential energy of the ball at the top of the plane. Given the gravitational constant 'g', we can say that the potential energy equals mgh.\n\nStep 3) We now need to calculate the kinetic energy of the ball as it rolls down. This energy differs because it's split into two kinds: rotational kinetic energy and translational kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is thus (1/2)mv\u00b2 + (1/2)I\u03c9\u00b2.\n\nStep 4) Use the principle of conservation of energy to equate the potential energy to the total kinetic energy, which leads us to the equation (1/2)mv\u00b2 + (1/2)I\u03c9\u00b2 = mgh.\n\nStep 5) But for a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about its centre can be defined as I = (2/5)mr\u00b2. So substitute I = (2/5)mr\u00b2 into our equation from Step 4.\n\nStep 6) We can simplify our equation further, we also know that v = r\u03c9 , substituting this into our equation from Step 5, we left with v\u00b2(7/10) = gh, thus final velocity of the sphere v is given by v = \u221a(10gh/7). Since the height of both planes is the same, the velocity of the sphere when it reaches the bottom will also be the same, regardless of the differences in their inclinations.\n\nStep 7) We look into the times it takes for the sphere to roll down the two different planes. For two planes with inclinations \u03b81 and \u03b82 (where \u03b81 < \u03b82), we can calculate the acceleration due to gravity along the plane with these inclinations as gsin\u03b81 and gsin\u03b82 respectively.\n\nStep 8) Using acceleration in the first equation of motion, we find that the time taken is directly proportional to the inverse of acceleration (t \u221d 1/a). So, for plane \u03b81, time t1 will be proportional to 1/a1, and for plane \u03b82, time t2 will be proportional to 1/a2.\n\nStep 9) Because sin \u03b82 > sin \u03b81 (since \u03b82 > \u03b81), it follows that a2 > a1. So, because t is inversely proportional to a, we can determine that t2 < t1. This tells us that the ball will take a longer time to reach the bottom if the inclination is less steep, or in other words, when it rolls down the plane with the smaller inclination.",

        "Original Solution": "Given\r\nThe radius of the ring, r = 2 m\r\nMass of the ring, m = 100 kg\r\nVelocity of the hoop, v = 20 cm/s = 0.2 m/s\r\nTotal energy of the loop = Rotational K.E. + Translational K.E.ET = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2) I \u03c9^2\r\nWe know the moment of inertia of a ring about its centre, I = mr^2ET = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2) (mr^2)\u03c9^2\r\nAlso, we know v = r\u03c9\r\nET = ( 1/2 )mv^2 + ( 1/2 )mr^2\u03c9^2\r\n=> ( 1/2 )mv^2 + ( 1/2 )mv^2 = mv^2\r\nThus, the amount of energy required to stop the ring = Total energy of the loop\r\nThe amount of work required, W = mv2 = 100 \u00d7 (0.2)^2 = 4 J.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start with understanding the problem. The hoop is already in motion, and we need to calculate the amount of work needed to stop it. It's crucial to understand that the moving hoop has two types of kinetic energy: rotational and translational. Thus, we need to account for both of these energies when solving the problem. \nStep 2) We're given the following quantities: the radius of the hoop 'r' is 2 m, the mass of the hoop 'm' is 100 kg, and the speed at the hoop's center of mass 'v' is 20 cm/s (or 0.2 m/s in SI units). \nStep 3) We set up the total energy equation of the hoop. The total energy ET of the hoop is the sum of its rotational kinetic energy and translational kinetic energy, so ET = (1/2)mv^2 (translational) + (1/2)I\u03c9^2 (rotational). 'I' is the moment of inertia, and '\u03c9' is the angular velocity. \nStep 4) As we know, the moment of inertia 'I' of a hoop about its center is 'mr^2'. Also, we know the velocity of the center of mass v = r\u03c9. So we substitute I and \u03c9 in the total energy formula. Thus getting ET = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2)m(r^2)(r\u03c9)^2 . This simplifies to ET = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2)mv^2 = mv^2. \nStep 5) Now, we calculate the actual work required to stop the hoop. We need to equate the total amount of kinetic energy of the hoop to the work done to stop it. So, Work done (W) = mv^2. Substituting known values, we get W = 100 x (0.2)^2 = 4 Joules.

This moment of inertia is about an axis through its centre perpendicular to the lines joining the two atoms. Step 3) The average speed of the molecule, v, is given as 500 m/s. Step 4) Assuming the distance between the two atoms can be represented as 2r. We can use the formula for moment of inertia here to get l = (m/2)r^2 + (m/2)r^2 = mr^2. From this, we can solve for r to find the distance between the atoms as r = (I / m)^(1/2). Hence, r = (1.94 \u00d7 10^(-46) / 5.36 \u00d7 10^(-26))^(1/2) = 0.60 \u00d7 10^(-10) m.

Initially, the cylinder will have kinetic energy in two forms: translational and rotational. Hence, we can write 0.5 * mv\u00b2 + 0.5 * I\u03c9\u00b2 = mgh, where m is the mass of the cylinder, v is its velocity, I is its moment of inertia, \u03c9 is its angular velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height to which the cylinder rolls up the slope. Step 3) Simplify the equations: The moment of inertia of a solid cylinder rotating about its center is 0.5 * mr\u00b2 and the relation between angular and linear velocity is \u03c9 = v/r. Substituting the moment of inertia and the relationship between linear and angular velocities into the equation, we get 3/4 * mv\u00b2 = mgh. In this step, we make use of the fact that for a solid cylinder, the ratio of kinetic energy of translation to that of rotation is always 2:1. Step 4) Solve for h: Dividing the entire equation by m and then solving for h, we get h = 3v\u00b2 / 4g = (3 \u00d7 5\u00b2) / (4 \u00d7 9.8) = 1.913 m. So, the cylinder will climb a physical height of 1.913 m from the bottom of the incline. Step 5) Convert height to distance up the slope: The height h and the distance d the cylinder goes up the inclined plane are related by the equation sin \u03b8 = h/d. Solving for d, we get d = h/sin \u03b8 = 1.913/sin 30 = 3.826 m. So, the cylinder will roll 3.826 m up the incline. Step 6) Determine the time for the cylinder to roll back down: Let's consider downward as the positive direction while going back then the net acceleration of the cylinder will be a combination of its translational and rotational accelerations. The time taken can be now calculated using the formula t = \u221a(2d * (1+ K\u00b2/r\u00b2) / gsin \u03b8) = \u221a( 2*3.826 * (1 + 1/2) / 9.8*sin30) = 1.53 s. Hence, the cylinder will take 1.53 s to return to the bottom of the incline.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the problem: We are given the initial speed of the cylinder and the incline angle of the plane. We are to find the distance up the plane and the return time of the cylinder. Step 2) Use the conservation of energy: The initial kinetic energy (both translational and rotational) equals to the potential energy at the highest point. This gives the equation 0.5 * mv\u00b2 + 0.5 * I\u03c9\u00b2 = mgh. Step 3) Simplification: Replace I with 0.5 * mr\u00b2 and \u03c9 with v/r and simplify the equation to 3/4 * mv\u00b2 = mgh. Step 4) Solve for height: Solving the simplified energy equation for h gives h = 3v\u00b2 / 4g. Step 5) Distance up the slope: Convert h to d using the trigonometric relation between height and distance along the slope, d = h/sin \u03b8. Step 6) Return time: The return time t is found by using the derived formula t = \u221a(2d * (1+ K\u00b2/r\u00b2) / gsin \u03b8)."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin by identifying and stating the known quantities provided within the problem. These include: mass of each weight (5 kg), moment of inertia of man-platform system (7.6 kg m^2), initial and final distance of weights from the axis (90cm and 20cm accordingly), and the initial angular speed (30 revolutions/minute).\nStep 2) Calculate the initial moment of inertia when his arms are fully stretched to 90 cm using the formula for the moment of inertia of a point mass, which is I = 2 * m * r^2. Plugging the known values, we get 2 * 5 * (0.9)^2 = 8.1 kg m^2.\nStep 3) Add this value of moment of inertia to the moment of inertia of the man-platform system. The total initial moment of inertia (denote it as Ii) turns out to be 7.6 + 8.1 = 15.7 kg m^2.\nStep 4) Use the fact that the angular momentum Li equals the moment of inertia times the angular speed (Li = Ii * \u03c9i). The initial angular momentum is therefore 15.7 * 30 = 471.\nStep 5) The man now brings his arms inwards. We calculate the new moment of inertia in a similar fashion to Step 2. Following the same formula, I = 2 * m * r^2, and substituting known values, we obtain 2 * 5 * (0.2)^2 = 0.4 kg m^2.\nStep 6) Adding this number to the moment of inertia of the man-platform system, the final moment of inertia (If) becomes 7.6 + 0.4 = 8.0 kg m^2.\nStep 7) The final angular momentum, Lf, is given by If * \u03c9f (where \u03c9f is the final angular speed we are trying to find).\nStep 8) From the conservation of angular momentum, we know that the initial and final angular momenta should be equal, meaning Li = Lf, or Ii\u03c9i = If\u03c9f. Solving this equation for \u03c9f yields \u03c9f = 471/8 = 58.88 rev/min.\nStep 9) In part (b), we recognize that kinetic energy of rotation changes due to the change in moment of inertia. An increase in rotational speed implies an increase in kinetic energy. As energy must be conserved, we conclude that the increase in kinetic energy must have originated from the work done by the man when he pulled his arms inwards.",

It is hinged at one end and rotates about a vertical axis practically without friction. Find the angular speed of the door just after the bullet embeds into it.\r\n(Hint: The moment of inertia of the door about the vertical axis at one end is ML2/3.)",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's list down the known values from the problem. The velocity of the bullet (v) is 500 m/s, its mass (m) is 10 g which is equivalent to 10 \u00d7 10^(\u20133) kg, the width of the door (L) is 1 m and the mass of the door (M) is 10 kg. \n\nStep 2) We're trying to find the angular speed of the door just after the bullet embeds in it. In order to do that, we need to understand a few fundamental concepts in physics. The angular momentum (\u03b1) can be calculated by the product of mass, velocity, and the radius from the center of rotation (r). The radius here is the distance from where the bullet strikes to the axis of rotation, which is half of the door's width. So, r = L / 2.\n\nStep 3) Calculating the angular momentum imparted by the bullet on the door using the formula \u03b1 = mvr, we get 2.5 kg m^2 s^(-1).\n\nStep 4) Next, using the moment of inertia of the door that is given by the formula I = (ML^2) / 3, we get 4 kgm^2. This equation is essential because it relates the angular momentum, moment of inertia, and angular velocity. The moment of inertia is a measure of the resistance of the door to rotational motion about the hinge point.\n\nStep 5) We know from the principle of conservation of angular momentum that the initial angular momentum of the door-bullet system (just after the bullet embeds into the door) equals the final angular momentum. Thus, equating the angular momentum imparted by the bullet on the door (\u03b1) to I\u03c9 and isolating \u03c9, we get \u03c9 = \u03b1 / I.\n\nStep 6) Finally, substituting \u03b1 and I into that equation, we find the angular speed of the door \u03c9 to be 0.625 rad/s. This means that just after the bullet embeds into the door, the door is rotating about its axis at a speed of 0.625 radians per second.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin with understanding the given values in the problem. We have two discs with moments of inertia I1 and I2 respectively. They are rotating with angular speeds \u03c91 and \u03c92 respectively. Step 2) Calculate the initial angular momenta of the individual discs. The angular momentum of a rotating object is given by the product of its moment of inertia and its angular speed. So for disc one it is L1 = I1\u03c91 and for disc two it is L2= I2\u03c92. Step 3) Sum up the individual momenta to get total initial angular momentum. Li = I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92. Step 4) When these two discs are brought together, their moments of inertia add up, and they rotate with a common angular speed \u03c9. So, the moment of inertia of the combined system (I) is I = I1 + I2. Therefore, the new total angular momentum (LT) is LT = (I1 + I2) \u03c9. Step 5) Apply the conservation of angular momentum, this principle states that the total angular momentum before the collision is equal to the total angular momentum after. So, LT = Li, which equates to I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92 = (I1 + I2)\u03c9. Step 6) Solve the equation for \u03c9 to find the angular speed of the combined system as \u03c9 = (I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92) / (I1 + I2) .

K.E1 = 1/2 I1(\u03c91)^2 for disc one and K.E2 = 1/2 I2(\u03c92)^2 for disc two. Step 8) Sum these energies to get the total initial kinetic energy, KEI = (1/2) ( I1(\u03c91)^2 + I2(\u03c92)^2). Step 9) The final kinetic energy after the discs come together is given by KEF = 1/2 ( I1 + I2) \u03c9^2. Replace \u03c9 in this equation with the value found in Step 6. This gives: KEF = 1/2 (I1 + I2) [ (I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92) / (I1 + I2) ]^2. or, KEF = (1/2) (I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92)^2 / (I1 + I2).

After solving the equation, this equals I1 I2 (\u03c91 \u2013 \u03c92)^2 / 2(I1 + I2), which proves to be positive.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, let's note down the information we have from the problem. The radius of the solid disc and the ring (r) is 10 cm or 0.10 m, the initial angular speed (\u03c90) is 10 \u03c0 rad s\u20131, and the coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bck) is 0.2. \n\nStep 2) The movement of these objects is caused by the force of friction. From Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion, we know that force equals mass times acceleration (f = ma). Since the force here is friction, we write it as \u03bckmg = ma. \n\nStep 3) If we rearrange the equation to solve for the acceleration (a), we have a = \u03bckg, where 'm' represents the mass and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity. \n\nStep 4) Now, we refer to the first equation of motion - v = u + at - where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity and at is the product of acceleration and time. In our scenario, the initial velocity u is 0 (the objects are initially at rest), hence we can simplify the equation to v = \u03bckgt.\n\nStep 5) The frictional force applies torque in a perpendicularly outward direction, reducing the initial angular speed. We depict this with the equation - Torque (T) = \u2212I\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the Angular acceleration and 'I' represents rotational inertia.\n\nStep 6) By rearranging the above formula, we find that angular acceleration \u03b1 = -\u03bckmgr / I.\n\nStep 7) Applying the first equation of rotational motion, \u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03b1t, we substitute \u03b1 in terms of -\u03bckmgr / I from the step above, obtaining \u03c9 =  \u03c90 + (-\u03bckmgr / I )t\n\nStep 8) Rolling starts when the linear velocity equals the product of radius and angular velocity - v = r\u03c9. Plugging in \u03c9 from the previous step, we get v = r(\u03c90 - \u03bckmgrt / I). \n\nStep 9) Equating v from step 4 and step 8, and simplifying the resulting equation, we get: \u03bckgt = r\u03c90 - \u03bckmgr^2t / I .\n\nStep 10) To find out when does each object start rolling, we need to substitute I for each object and solve for 't'. For the ring, I = mr^2 and hence the time it would start rolling (tR) = r\u03c90 / 2\u03bckg = ( 0.1 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3.14) / (2 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 10 ) = 0.80 s.\n\nStep 11) For the disc, the moment of inertia (I) is different, I = (1/2)mr^2. Hence the time it would start rolling (tD) = r\u03c90 / 3\u03bckg = ( 0.1 x 10 \u00d7 3.14) / (3 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 9.8 ) = 0.53 s.\n\nStep 12) Comparing the times, we see that tD < tR, implying that the disc will start to roll earlier than the ring.",

        "Question": "Q32. Read each statement below carefully, and state, with reasons, if it is true or false.\r\n(a) During rolling, the force of friction acts in the same direction as the direction of motion of the CM of the body.\r\n(b) The instantaneous speed of the point of contact during rolling is zero.\r\n(c) The instantaneous acceleration of the point of contact during rolling is zero.\r\n(d) For perfect rolling motion, work done against friction is zero.\r\n(e) A wheel moving down a perfectly frictionless inclined plane will undergo slipping (not rolling) motion.",
        "Original Solution": "(a) False. The direction of frictional force is opposite to the direction of motion of the centre of mass. In the case of a rolling object, the centre of mass moves backwards, so the frictional force acts in the forward direction\r\n(b) True. During rolling, the point of the body in contact with the ground does not move ahead (this would be slipping) instead, it only touches the ground for an instant and lifts off following a curve. Thus, only if the point of contact remains in touch with the ground and moves forward will the instantaneous speed not be equal to zero.\r\n(c) False. For a rolling object, instantaneous acceleration will have a value it is not zero\r\n(d ) True. This is because during perfect rolling frictional force is zero, so work done against it is zero.\r\n(d)  True. This is because during perfect rolling frictional force is zero, so work done against it is zero.\r\n(e) True. Rolling occurs only when there is a frictional force to provide the torque, so in the absence of friction, the wheel simply slips down the plane under the influence of its weight.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understanding the problem: The question presents multiple statements with different concepts embedded. We are going to determine if the statements are true or false and provide the reasons behind it. Step 2) For Statement (a): 'During rolling, the force of friction acts in the same direction as the direction of motion of the Centre of Mass (CM) of the body', it is stated as false. Reason: In physics, the force of friction acts in a direction opposite to the direction of motion. When a body rolls, the CM of the body moves in one direction and the frictional force provides a retarding force in the opposite direction to prevent slipping. Step 3) For Statement (b): 'The instantaneous speed of the point of contact during rolling is zero', it is stated as true. Reason: During rolling, the point of contact is constantly changing. At any instant, the specific point in contact with the ground is momentarily at rest, thus the instantaneous speed is zero. This prevents slipping and ensures smooth rolling instead. Step 4) For Statement (c): 'The instantaneous acceleration of the point of contact during rolling is zero', it is stated as false. Reason: Even though the point of contact has zero instantaneous speed, it doesn't mean its acceleration is zero. As the points on the rolling body move along a circular path, they are constantly changing direction. This directional change represents acceleration. Step 5) For Statement (d): 'For perfect rolling motion, work done against friction is zero', it is stated as true. Reason: During perfect rolling, the motion of the body is such that there is no relative movement or slippage at the point of contact with the ground. This means frictional force does not do any work, hence, the work done against friction is zero. Step 6) For Statement (e): 'A wheel moving down a perfectly frictionless inclined plane will undergo slipping (not rolling) motion', it is stated as true. Reason: Friction brings about the turning of a wheel down an inclined plane. If the inclined plane is frictionless, the wheel won't roll but will rather slide or slip down under its weight.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Interpret the problem: It presents a series of statements for us to verify as true or false. Step 2) Analyzing Statement (a): It says that during rolling, the force of friction acts in the same direction as the motion of the CM. This is false because the frictional force opposes the motion to prevent slipping. Step 3) Analyzing Statement (b): It states that the instantaneous speed of the point of contact during rolling is zero, which is true. This happens because the point of contact is momentarily at rest during rolling. Step 4) Analyzing Statement (c): The statement contends that the instantaneous acceleration of the point of contact during rolling is zero. This is false because the constant change in direction of the points on the body means there is acceleration. Step 5) Analyzing Statement (d): The statement claims that the work done against friction is zero in case of perfect rolling. This is true because in perfect rolling, frictional force doesn\u2019t do any work as there is no slipping. Step 6) Analyzing Statement (e): It states that a wheel slips down a perfectly frictionless inclined plane, which is true as without friction there is no torque to induce rolling and the wheel just slips down under its weight."

        "Question": "1: Answer the following.\r\n(a) You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor. Can you shield a body from the gravitational influence of nearby matter by putting it inside a hollow sphere or by some other means?\r\n(b) An astronaut inside a small spaceship orbiting around the earth cannot detect gravity. If the space station orbiting around the earth has a large size, can he hope to detect gravity?\r\n(c) If you compare the gravitational force on the earth due to the sun to that due to the moon, you would find that the Sun\u2019s pull is greater than the moon\u2019s pull. (You can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises.) However, the tidal effect of the moon\u2019s pull is greater than the tidal effect of the sun. Why?   ",
        "Original Solution": "(a). No, as of now, no method has been devised to shield a body from gravity because gravity is independent of the medium, and it is the virtue of each and every matter. So the shield would exert gravitational forces.\r\n(b). Yes, if the spaceship is large enough, then the astronaut will definitely detect Mars\u2019s gravity.\r\n(c). Gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, whereas Tidal effects are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. So as the distance between the earth and the moon is smaller than the distance between the earth and the sun, the moon will have a greater influence on the earth\u2019s tidal waves.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first question asks if we can block the effects of gravitational forces by placing an object inside a hollow sphere or by any other method. The reality is gravity is a property associated with the mass of an object and acts across distances, whether those distances include a medium like air, or are a vacuum, like space. Hence, gravity is not affected by placing something inside a hollow sphere. This is why we can't shield an object from gravitational forces. Gravitational forces are present anywhere there is matter and cannot be blocked or shielded in any way.\n\nStep 2) The second question requires you to consider if an astronaut inside a larger spaceship could detect gravity. The key to understand here is that gravity acts on all masses, regardless of their size. A larger spaceship, due to its increased mass, will experience a more noticeable gravitational pull, especially when it is near a large celestial body like a planet. Thus, an astronaut inside a significantly large spaceship would indeed be able to detect gravitational forces.\n\nStep 3) The final question requires an understanding of two quantities related to gravity: the gravitational force and the tidal effect. Both are related to the distance between bodies, yet in different ways. Gravitational force follows the inverse-square law, meaning it decreases with the square of the distance, while tidal effects are proportional to the inverse cube of the distance. So, even though the Sun exerts a stronger overall gravitational pull on the Earth due to its significantly larger mass than the Moon, the Moon's closer proximity means it has a greater influence on the Earth\u2019s tides. Therefore, the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull causes a greater tidal effect than the Sun's gravitational pull.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) In dealing with gravitational forces, remember that they cannot be shielded or blocked by enclosing an object inside a hollow sphere or by any other means because gravity acts across distances and through mediums, affecting all matter. Gravity isn't affected by enclosures.\n\nStep 2) Understanding that gravity affects all masses and the effect gets stronger with increasing mass and decreasing distance, it follows that an astronaut in a large spaceship could detect gravitational forces, especially when the spaceship is near a large celestial body like a planet.\n\nStep 3) Gravitational force and tidal effects depend upon the distance between the bodies in different ways. The gravitational force follows the inverse-square law, and tidal effects follow the inverse-cube law. Hence, the closer Moon, despite having less overall gravitational pull, has a greater tidal effect on Earth than the sun due to its close proximity."

        "Question": "2. Choose the correct alternative.\r\n(a) Acceleration due to gravity increases/decreases with increasing altitude.\r\n(b) Acceleration due to gravity increases/decreases with increasing depth (assume the earth to be a sphere of uniform density).\r\n(c) Acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the earth/mass of the body.\r\n(d) The formula \u2013G M m(1/r 2 \u2013 1/r1) is more/less accurate than the formula mg(r2 \u2013 r1) for the difference of potential energy between two points r2 and r1 distance away from the centre of the earth.",
        "Original Solution": "(a) decreases\r\n(b) decreases\r\n(c) mass of the body\r\n(d) more",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Consider the given alternatives related to gravity. Gravity is a force that attracts two bodies towards each other and it is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres, which is represented as F = G(Mm/r\u00b2), where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two bodies, and r is the distance between them. Step 2) Look at option (a) which states 'Acceleration due to gravity increases/decreases with increasing altitude'. As the altitude increases, the distance from the center of the Earth increases. This increases the denominator of the equation we discussed, which in turn decreases the gravitational force. Hence, the acceleration due to gravity decreases with increasing altitude. Step 3) Consider option (b) 'Acceleration due to gravity increases/decreases with increasing depth (assume the earth to be a sphere of uniform density)'. As we know, gravity is strongest at the surface of the earth and it decreases both ways, whether we go upwards (height) or downwards (depth). So, as the depth inside the Earth increases, the acceleration due to gravity decreases. Step 4) Look at option (c) 'Acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the earth/mass of the body'. As per Newton's law of universal gravitation, the acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the body, so the correct alternative is 'mass of the body'. Step 5) Consider option (d) 'The formula \u2013G M m(1/r2 \u2013 1/r1) is more/less accurate than the formula mg(r2 \u2013 r1) for the difference of potential energy between two points r2 and r1 distance away from the centre of the earth'. The first formula represents the difference in gravitational potential energy between two points in space using the universal law of gravitation. The second formula is an approximation that is only accurate for small differences in height near the surface of the Earth. Hence, the formula \u2013G M m(1/r2 \u2013 1/r1) is more accurate.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the gravity concept, expressed as F = G(Mm/r\u00b2). Step 2) For (a), as altitude increases, the distance 'r' from Earth's center increases, reducing the acceleration due to gravity. The correct choice is 'decreases'. Step 3) For (b), as depth increases, similar to altitude, the acceleration due to gravity decreases. So, the correct choice is 'decreases'. Step 4) For (c), recall Newton's law of universal gravitation. The acceleration due to gravity doesn't depend on the mass of the falling body, but on the mass of the Earth. Hence, the correct choice is 'mass of the body'. Step 5) For (d), compare the formulae \u2013G M m(1/r2 \u2013 1/r1) and mg(r2 \u2013 r1). The first is in line with the universal law of gravitation and hence is more accurate for distances away from the Earth's surface, while the latter is an approximation that works well for small differences in heights near the Earth's surface. So, the correct choice is 'more accurate'."

        "Question": "3: Suppose there existed a planet that went around the Sun twice as fast as the earth. What would be its orbital size as compared to that of the earth?",
        "Original Solution": "Time taken by the earth for one complete revolution, TE = 1 Year\r\nThe radius of Earth\u2019s orbit, RE = 1 AU\r\nThus, the time taken by the planet to complete one complete revolution\r\nTP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{2}\\end{array} \\)TE  = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{2}\\end{array} \\) year\r\nLet the orbital radius of this planet = RP\r\nNow, according to Kepler\u2019s third law of planetary motion,\r\nTherefore, the radius of the orbit of this planet is 0.63 times smaller than the radius of the orbit of the Earth.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by establishing known facts. The Earth takes 1 year to complete a revolution around the sun and the radius of Earth's orbit is known to be 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). Step 2) Next, given that the hypothetical planet moves twice as fast as Earth, it would complete a revolution in half the Earth's time, i.e., 0.5 years or 1/2 TE, where TE represents the Earth's revolutionary period. Step 3) Now, let's define RP as the radius of this planet's orbit. Our task is to find the relationship between RP and RE (the radius of Earth's orbit). Step 4) For this, we use Kepler's third law. This law states that the square of the period of a planet's revolution (T) is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit (R). Mathematically, this is expressed as T^2 \u221d R^3. Step 5) We can adjust this equation to solve for R to find a relationship between the planet's orbital radius and the Earth's. We do so by rewriting the relationship as R = (T^2)^(1/3). Step 6) Finally, we plug the planet's period of revolution (TP = 0.5 years) into the newly organized formula: RP = (TP^2)^(1/3), and realize that the radius of the orbit of this planet would be about 0.63 times the radius of Earth's orbit. Hence, this planet's orbit is smaller than that of the Earth.",

Step 5) Rearrange this law to express the semimajor axis (or radius) in terms of the period of revolution. Step 6) Apply this new formula to the hypothetical planet using its period of revolution, thus calculating its orbital size relative to Earth's orbit."

Step 2) Note that the mass of any celestial body can be found using the equation MJ = 4\u03c0^2(RI0)^3 / G(TI0)^2 where G is the universal gravitational constant and T is the orbital period. This is an application of Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion which relates the orbit's semi-major axis to its period. Step 3) The given problem asks to compare Jupiter's mass to the mass of the Sun. So, you need to also use the equation for the mass of the Sun, MS = 4\u03c0^2(RE)^3 / G(TE)^2, where RE is Earth's orbital radius and TE is Earth's orbital period. This equation also stems from Kepler's Third Law. Step 4) To compare the two masses, use the equation MS/MJ = (RE/RI0)\u00b3 * (TI0/TE)\u00b2. This equation is derived by dividing the formula for the mass of the Sun by the formula for the mass of Jupiter, cancelling similar terms and rearranging them. This equation gives the ratio of the masses. Step 5) Substitute the values into the formula to find the ratio of the Sun's mass to Jupiter's mass: [1.769 * 24 * 60 * 60 / 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60]\u00b2 * [1.496 \u00d7 10^11 / 4.22 \u00d7 10^8]\u00b3.

The mass of our galaxy is given as 2.5 x 10^11 solar mass, and each solar mass equates to 2 x 10^30 kg.

Choose the correct alternative.(a) If the zero of potential energy is at infinity, the total energy of an orbiting satellite is negative of its kinetic/potential energy.(b) The energy required to launch an orbiting satellite out of the earth\u2019s gravitational influence is more/less than the energy required to project a stationary object at the same height (as the satellite) out of the earth\u2019s influence.",
        "Original Solution": "(a) If the zero potential energy is at infinity, the total energy of an orbiting satellite is negative of its kinetic energy.\r\n(b) The energy required to launch an orbiting satellite out of Earth\u2019s gravitational influence is less than the energy required to project a stationary object at the same height (as the satellite) out of Earth\u2019s influence.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first part of our problem deals with understanding some basic physics concepts, namely potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy. In physics, potential energy at a reference point, such as infinity in our case, is often taken to be zero. Step 2) On this basis, the total energy of an orbiting satellite is actually the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. But, since the potential energy is zero at infinity, total energy is only constituted by the kinetic energy of the satellite. Step 3) Consequently, if total energy is equal to kinetic energy, the condition attached in the problem statement where total energy is negative indicates that the kinetic energy should be a negative value (because a positive added to a negative gives a negative). Thus, the negative of kinetic energy (a negative value) would be a positive, equating to the total energy of the satellite that is: Total Energy = -Kinetic Energy. Step 4) For the second part of the question, it revolves around the amount of energy required to escape Earth's gravitational influence. For an orbiting satellite, it already has significant kinetic energy (as it is moving) that can be used to overcome some of the Earth's gravitational force. Step 5) In contrast, a stationary object at the same height as the satellite would require more energy to achieve the same result, as it does not have this initial kinetic energy to help it overcome gravity. Therefore, it takes less energy to launch an orbiting satellite out of Earth\u2019s gravitational influence than it would to project a stationary object at the same height out of Earth\u2019s influence.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Conceptualize the problem by understanding the principles of potential energy and kinetic energy. Here potential energy is zero at infinity according to conventional physics principles. Step 2) Recognize that our total energy is defined as the sum of kinetic and potential energies. Hence, total energy equals kinetic energy in this scenario. Step 3) We ascertain that total energy is negative, hence this implies that kinetic energy is negative. So the total energy of the satellite is -Kinetic Energy. Step 4) To interpret the second part of the problem, we realize that an orbiting satellite already possesses significant kinetic energy due to its motion which aids it in negating some gravitational force. Step 5) Understand that a stationary object requires more energy to overcome gravity as it lacks the initial kinetic energy that the satellite has. Hence, launching a satellite needs less energy compared to projecting a stationary object at the same height out of gravitational influence."

        "Question": "7. Does the escape speed of a body from the earth depend on (a) the mass of the body, (b) the location from where it is projected, (c) the direction of projection, (d) the height ofthe location from where the body is launched?",
        "Original Solution": "The escape speed is given by the expression\r\n(a) The escape speed of a body from the Earth does not depend on the mass of the body.\r\n(b) The escape speed of a body from the Earth does not depend on the location from where a body is projected.\r\n(c) The escape speed does not depend on the direction of the projection of a body.\r\n(d) The escape speed of a body depends upon the height of the location from where the body is launched since the escape velocity depends on the gravitational potential at the point from which it is launched. This potential, in turn, depends on the height.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that the escape speed of a body from Earth is given by a specific mathematical expression, derived from principles of physics. This expression incorporates the gravitational constant, the mass of the Earth, and the radius of the Earth. Importantly, note that this expression does not include the mass of the object, the location from which it is projected, or the direction of projection. Step 2) From this understanding, conclude that the escape speed does not depend on the mass of the body being projected. This is because the mass of the body does not appear in our escape speed equation. Step 3) Infer the independence of escape speed from the location of projection; since our formula does not include any terms that would suggest a dependency on the location, we deduce that this factor does not impact escape speed. Step 4) Understand that the formula also doesn't consider the direction of projection, thus we can infer that escape speed is not influenced by this either. Step 5) Consider the impact of the height from where the body is launched, which does play a role in the escape speed. This is due to how gravitational potential energy (included implicitly in our formula) changes with height. The higher up a body is launched from, the lesser the escape speed required, as the body would already have overcome a part of the Earth's gravitational pull.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the formula for escape speed and its variables - Does not include mass of the object, location or direction of projection. Step 2) Conclude that escape speed is independent of the mass of the projected body - the formula doesn't include the mass of the projected body. Step 3) Note that the location where the object is projected from doesn't affect escape speed \u2013 the formula doesn't include this factor. Step 4) Recognize the escape speed doesn't depend on the direction of projection - the formula doesn't account for this either. Step 5) Understand that the height from where the body is launched does influence the escape speed \u2013 This is due to its relation with the gravitational potential energy."

Does the comet have a constant (a) linear speed (b) angular speed (c) angular momentum (d) kinetic energy (e) potential energy (f) total energy throughout its orbit? Neglect any mass loss of the comet when it comes very close to the Sun.",
        "Original Solution": "(a) According to Kepler\u2019s second law, the linear speed of the comet keeps changing. When the comet is near the sun, its speed will be the fastest, and when it is far away from the sun, its speed will be the least.\r\n(b) Angular speed also varies slightly.\r\n(c) Comet has constant angular momentum.\r\n(d) Kinetic energy changes.\r\n(e) Potential energy changes along the path.\r\n(f) Total energy will remain constant throughout the orbit",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Starting with the first part of our problem, we need to determine if the comet's linear speed is constant during its orbit. Using Kepler\u2019s second law, which states that a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times, we know that the linear speed of the comet is not constant. In essence, when the comet is near the sun it moves faster, covering a larger arc of its orbit, and when it's far from the sun, it moves slower, covering a smaller arc. The speed of the comet therefore changes depending on its distance from the sun. \nStep 2) Continuing to the second part of our problem, we need to find out if the comet's angular speed is constant. The angular speed also carries dependence on the location of the comet in its orbit. It varies slightly due to the comet's elliptical path around the sun, not remaining constant throughout the orbit.\nStep 3) Next, we address if the comet maintains constant angular momentum throughout its orbit. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, the angular momentum of the comet does remain constant. This principle states that the total angular momentum does not change unless acted on by an external torque. In other words, the speed and direction of the comet may change, but its angular momentum remains the same.\nStep 4) We move onto the kinetic energy aspect of the problem. The kinetic energy changes as the comet changes its speed (either accelerating or decelerating) along its orbit. Hence, the more the comet's speed changes, the more the kinetic energy changes as well.\nStep 5) Fifthly, we consider the comet's potential energy. Potential energy is associated with the comet's position in relation to the gravitational pull of the sun and also varies along the orbit. The further the comet is from the sun, the higher the potential energy, and vice versa.\nStep 6) Lastly, we need to determine if the comet's total energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant throughout its orbit. Although the kinetic energy and potential energy fluctuate, the total energy of the comet stays constant. This is due to the conservation of energy law, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We utilize Kepler's second law to ascertain that the comet's linear speed is not constant, as it varies based on the comet's location in its orbit around the sun.\nStep 2) The angular speed of the comet is not constant and also slightly varies as a result of the elliptical orbit. \nStep 3) Using the principle of conservation of angular momentum, we determine that the comet's angular momentum remains constant throughout its orbit.\nStep 4) Given that kinetic energy is tied to the speed of the comet, as the comet's speed changes, so does its kinetic energy.\nStep 5) The potential energy, which is related to the comet's distance from the sun, changes along the orbit. \nStep 6) Despite fluctuations in kinetic and potential energy, the total energy of the comet (kinetic energy + potential energy) remains constant due to the law of conservation of energy."

        "Question": "9. Which of the following symptoms is likely to afflict an astronaut in space (a) swollen feet, (b) swollen face, (c) headache, (d) orientational problem.",
        "Original Solution": "(a). In zero gravity, the blood flow to the feet isn\u2019t increased, so the astronaut does not get swollen feet.\r\n(b). There is more supply of blood to the face of the astronaut. Therefore, the astronaut will have a swollen face.\r\n(c). Due to increased blood supply to their faces, astronauts can be affected by headaches.\r\n(d). Space has different orientations, so orientational problems can affect an astronaut.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Analyze the first symptom: swollen feet. In zero gravity, the gravitational pull towards the earth's surface is absent. Normally, gravity contributes to pulling blood down towards our feet, but in space, this doesn't happen. Thus, an astronaut in space does not experience an increasing blood supply to the feet, preventing feet from swelling. Step 2) Examine the second symptom: swollen face. In contrast to Earth, where gravity pulls much of our blood downwards, in space, blood tends to flow towards the upper body and head. As a result, the face receives a more significant blood supply, leading to swelling. Step 3) Consider the third symptom: headache. Increased blood supply to the face isn't just noticeable in terms of outward swelling. This situation can also cause pressure internally, leading to possible headaches. Step 4) Evaluate the final symptom: orientation problem. Space lacks a defined 'up' or 'down,' which is typically provided by gravity. Without this consistent sense of direction, astronauts must depend on visual cues to maintain orientation, which can lead to confusion or disorientation.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Consideration of swollen feet - here, we comprehend how the lack of gravity in space reduces blood flow to the feet, preventing them from swelling. Step 2) Analysis of swollen face - this stage entails understanding how the absence of gravitational pull on blood allows more blood to flow towards the face, causing it to swell. Step 3) Consideration of headache - due to the increased blood flow in the upper body, when in space, this can induce headaches. Step 4) Evaluation of orientation problem - since space has a different sense of direction, astronauts may experience orientational issues, mostly due to the lack of natural 'up' or 'down.'"

Step 2) We want to find the point P at a distance x from the centre of the earth where the gravitational force on the rocket becomes zero, assuming P is along the line connecting the centers of Earth and Sun. Step 3) By Newton's law of gravitation, the force on an object is given by the formula F = G * (M1 * M2)/d^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two bodies, and d is the distance between them. At point P, the gravitational forces exerted on the rocket by the Earth and the Sun would be equal but opposite in direction, hence equating them gives us the equation GmMsun/(r-x)^2 = GmMearth/x^2.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem gives us the mean orbital radius of the earth around the sun, which is 1.5 \u00d7 10^8 km. However, our calculations need to be in meters, so we convert this value to meters, which gives us 1.5 \u00d7 10^11 m.

One year is equal to 365.25 days, one day is equal to 24 hours, one hour is equal to 60 minutes, and one minute is equal to 60 seconds.

The gravitational constant G is a key component in this law and is given as 6.67 \u00d7 10^(-11) Nm^2 kg^(-2).

This formula is essentially the force of gravitation rearranged to solve for M, by using the fact that this force keeps the Earth in its orbit around the sun.

This equation tells us that the ratio of the cubes of the average distances of two planets from the Sun is equal to the ratio of the squares of their orbital periods. Step 7) Isolating rs, we get rs = re(Ts/Te)^2/3. This equation allows us to solve for Saturn's mean distance from the Sun in terms of Earth's mean distance from the Sun and the ratio of their orbital periods. Step 8) Substituting known values into the formula, we get rs = 1.5 x 10^8 x (29.5)^2/3 = 14.3 x 10^8 km. Thus, we find that Saturn is approximately 14.3 x 10^8 km from the Sun.",

This offers us a starting point for our calculations. Step 2) Next, we need to determine how weight changes with height. For this, we have a formula: g' = g / (1 + (h/Re))^2. This equation describes the acceleration due to gravity at a height 'h' from the Earth's surface. 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface and 'Re' signifies the radius of the Earth. Step 3) The given problem specifies the height is half the radius of the Earth. We replace 'h' in the formula with Re/2. So, g' = g / [ 1+ (Re/2Re) ]^2. This instructs us how gravity changes when we are at a height equal to half the radius of the Earth. Step 4) By simplifying this equation, we get g' = g / [ 1+ (1/2) ]^2=4g/9. From this, we learn that the gravitational acceleration at half the Earth's radius is four-ninths of the surface acceleration- a significant reduction! Step 5) Now we determine the weight of the body at that height. Weight is given by the product of mass and gravitational acceleration. Recalling that mass is weight divided by surface gravity, we find that the weight of the body at the required height, W', equals to its mass times g', or W' = m * (4g/9). But since m = W/g, with W being the surface weight, we can write this as W' = (W/g) * (4g/9) = (4/9)*W. That's a weight reduction to four-ninths of the initial weight, consistent with our reduced gravity. Step 6) Lastly, we apply the numbers. Replacing W with the given 63 N, we find that the weight at half the Earth's radius is (4/9)*63 = 28 N.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We understand from the problem that the weight of the body on the Earth's surface is given as 250 N, denoted as W. By formula, weight W = mass (m) times gravity (g) i.e., W=mg. Here, g refers to the acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface. Step 2) Since the Earth is a sphere, it's simply modeled by considering its radius as Re. Step 3) We want to find the weight of the body when it is halfway to the center of the Earth. Let's denote this distance as 'd'. Given that 'd' is halfway to the center, it is half the radius of the Earth (Re), i.e., d=Re/2. Step 4) The acceleration due to gravity is different at different depths within the Earth. It is given by the relation gd=(1- d/Re)g, where gd represents the acceleration due to gravity at a particular interior point 'd'. Step 5) Substituting d=Re/2 into the formula from step 4, we get gd=(1 - Re/2Re)g, which simplifies further to gd=g/2. This means that the acceleration due to gravity halfway down to the center is half of what it is at the surface. Step 6) The weight of the body at depth 'd' is given by W' = m * gd. Using the value of 'gd' from step 5, this means that W' = m * g/2, or that the weight is halved when it's halfway to the center of the Earth.

Step 3) Recognize that halfway into the Earth would be a distance d equal to Re/2. Step 4) Acknowledge that acceleration due to gravity, gd, changes with Earth's depth. This is given by the formula gd=(1 - d/Re)g. Step 5) Substitute in the value for 'd' from step 3 into the formula to find that gd=g/2. Step 6) Use the value of 'gd' to calculate the weight W' of the body at depth 'd'. Consequently, W' = W/2, meaning the weight halfway down is half that on the surface. Step 7) Thus, the body weighs 125 N halfway down based on the original weight of 250 N."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first thing we need to do is establish the problem: we are trying to determine whether an object will be able to stay affixed to the surface of a neutron star. For the object to stay on the surface of the star, the inward pull of gravity needs to be stronger than the outward push of centrifugal force. Therefore, we need to calculate both of these forces and compare them. Step 2) We begin by calculating the gravitational force. The formula to calculate the gravity force is fG = GMm/R^2. In this formula, G is the universal gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, m is the mass of the object that we want to stick to the star, and R is the radius of the star. Step 3) We know the M, G, and R values. M is given as 2.5 times the mass of the sun, or 5 x 10^30 kg (we get this by multiplying 2.5 by the known mass of the sun, which is 2 x 10^30 kg). The sun mass is a standard value that you should remember or can look up. Converting the star radius from kilometers to meters gives us 1.2 x 10^4 m. Finally, G is the universal gravitational constant, which is 6.67 x 10^-11 N(m/Kg)^2. Step 4) Substituting these values into the formula gives us fG = (6.67x10^-11)x(5x10^30)m/(1.2x10^4)^2 = 1.334x10^13mN. So, this is the gravitational pull on the object. Step 5) Now let's calculate the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force fc can be represented as fc = mR\u03c9^2, where m is the mass of the object, R is the radius of the star, and \u03c9 is the angular speed. Step 6) We convert the revolutions per second to angular speed, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03bd, where \u03bd is the revolution frequency, given as 1.2 rev/s. Plugging these values into the formula gives us fc = m x (1.2 x 10^4) x 4\u03c0^2 x (1.2)^2 = (6.82 x 10^5m) N. Step 7) Now we have the gravitational force and the centrifugal force. By comparing these two forces, we see that the gravitational force is greater than the centrifugal force (1.334x10^13N > 6.82x10^5N), meaning that the object will remain stuck to the surface of the neutron star.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) For an object to stick to a rotating body, the body's gravitational pull should be greater than the centrifugal force. Step 2) Compute the gravitational pull using the formula fG = GMm/R^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the star's mass, m is the object's mass, and R is the star's radius. Step 3) Plug the known values into the formula to get the gravitational force fG. Step 4) Compute the centrifugal force using the formula fc = mR\u03c9^2, where m is the object's mass, R is the star's radius, and \u03c9 is the angular speed. Step 5) Convert the given revolution speed per second to the angular speed, \u03c9. Step 6) Plug these values into the formula to calculate the centrifugal force, fc. Step 7) Compare the gravitational and centrifugal forces. The object stays on the neutron star's surface if the gravitational force is larger."

The spaceship is originally on Mars, and we are provided with the masses of the spaceship, the Sun, and Mars, the radius of Mars and its orbit, and the Universal Gravitational Constant G. Step 2) Understand the known quantities: We are given the mass of the spaceship (ms = 1000kg), the mass of the Sun (M = 2\u00d710^30 kg), the mass of Mars (mm = 6.4\u00d710^23 kg), the radius of the Mars orbit (R = 2.28\u00d710^11 m = 2.28\u00d710^8 km converted to meters), the radius of Mars (r = 3395\u00d710^3 m = 3395 km converted to meters), and the Universal Gravitational Constant (G = 6.67\u00d710^-11 N m^2 kg^\u22122).

Notice that both of these values are negative, indicating that the spaceship is bound to the system.

These are: the length and cross-sectional area of the steel wire (l1 = 4.7 m and a1 = 3.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2) and those of the copper wire (l2 = 3.5 m and a2 = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2). Note that both wires stretch by the same amount under a given load, so the change in length for both, \u0394l, is equal.

This is because, for the same value of stress, there is more strain in rubber than in steel. And as Young Modulus is an inverse of strain, it is greater in steel.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) This question presents two statements about the mechanical properties of materials and asks you to determine whether these statements are true or false. First, it is useful to understand the basic concepts. Young's modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It defines the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation) in a material. A high Young's modulus means a material is stiffer. On the other hand, shear modulus is a measure of the material's ability to resist shape changes (shear deformation) when subjected to shear stress. \nStep 2) We tackle the first statement: 'The Young\u2019s modulus of rubber is greater than that of steel.' For the same value of stress, there is more strain in rubber than in steel. The reason behind this is that rubber is more flexible and more prone to deformation under the same load compared to steel. \nStep 3) As Young's modulus is an inverse of strain (strains like stretching or bending), the more a material tends to deform for a given stress, the lower its Young\u2019s modulus will be. Hence, it is safe to conclude that Young\u2019s modulus of rubber is less than that of steel, not greater. Therefore, the first statement is false.\nStep 4) Now let's consider the second statement: 'The stretching of a coil is determined by its shear modulus.' It's important to understand the concept of 'stretching a coil' here; stretching a coil involves changing its shape, not its length. When a coil is stretched, the material does not experience a simple extension but a shear deformation.\nStep 5) The shear modulus comes into play when deformation of the material happens without a change in volume, like when the shape of a coil is changed by stretching it. So, it is true that the shear modulus determines the stretching of a coil. Therefore, the second statement is true.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the terms Young's modulus and shear modulus as they are measures of stiffness and ability to resist shape change in materials, respectively.\nStep 2) Address the first statement about Young's modulus of rubber being greater than steel by assessing the strain in both materials for the same value of stress. As rubber deforms more, its Young's modulus is thus lower than that of steel.\nStep 3) Confirm that the first statement is false due to the inverse relationship between Young's modulus and strain.\nStep 4) Analyze the second statement about the role of shear modulus in the stretching of a coil, considering that stretching a coil leads to a shape change, not a length change.\nStep 5) Agree that the second statement is true as the shear modulus is responsible for resisting deformation in shape, as seen in a stretched coil."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by identifying the known values: The edge of the aluminium cube, L, is given as 10 cm. To make subsequent calculations easier, we convert this length into meters by dividing by 100. So, L = 10/100 = 0.1 m. The mass attached to the opposite face of the cube is M = 100 kg.\nStep 2) Next, we need to calculate the area, A, of each cube face. Since a cube has all sides of equal length, we can square the length of the edge to get the area. Therefore, A = (0.1)^2 = 0.1 x 0.1 = 0.01 square meters (m^2).\nStep 3) We then determine the tangential force, F, acting on the face. Upon attaching the 100 kg mass to the face, it experiences a gravitational pull, F = M * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, taken as 9.8 m/s^2. Substituting for M, we find that F = 100 * 9.8 = 980 Newtons (N).\nStep 4) Introduce the definition of Shear modulus, \u03b7, which is the ratio of tangential stress to shearing strain. With the formula as '\u03b7 = Tangential stress/Shearing strain', we can rearrange and find the shearing strain = Tangential stress/ Shear modulus.\nStep 5) We substitute the values of F, A, and \u03b7, into the formula of shearing strain. Therefore, Shearing strain = F/A\u03b7 = 980 N/(0.01 m^2 * 25 * 10^9 N/m^2), which simplifies down to a shearing strain value of 3.92 * 10^-6.\nStep 6) Now, we need to find out the lateral strain, which is the ratio of the change in dimension of the material to its original dimension. Based on the fact that shearing strain equals the lateral strain over the side of the cube, we calculate the lateral strain to be the product of shearing strain and side of the cube = 3.92 * 10^-6 * 0.1 m. This gives us the value 3.92 * 10^-7 m, which can be approximated to 4 * 10^-7 m. This is our final solution: the vertical deflection of the face of the cube.",

        "Original Solution": "Mass of the big structure, M = 50,000 kg\r\nTotal force exerted on the four columns= Total weight of the structure=50000\u00d79.8N\r\nThe compressional force on each column = Mg/4 = (50000\u00d79.8)/4 N= 122500 N\r\nTherefore, Stress = 122500 N\r\nYoung\u2019s modulus of steel, Y=2\u00d710^11 Pa\r\nYoung\u2019s modulus, Y= Stress/Strain\r\nStrain = Young\u2019s modulus/Stress\r\nStrain = (F/A)/Y\r\nInner radius of the column, r = 30 cm = 0.3 m\r\nOuter radius of the column, R = 60 cm = 0.6 m\r\nWhere,\r\nArea, A=\u03c0(R^2\u2212r^2)=\u03c0((0.6)^2\u2212(0.3)^2) = 0.27 \u03c0 m^2\r\nStrain =122500/[0.27 x 3.14\u00d72\u00d710^11]=7.22\u00d710^\u22127\r\nHence, the compressional strain of each column is 7.22\u00d710^\u22127.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given the mass (M) of the structure to be 50,000 kg. Knowing that weight is mass times gravity, we multiply the mass of the structure by the acceleration due to gravity (g), which is 9.8 m/s^2, to find that the total force (F) exerted on the four columns is equal to the total weight of the structure (Mg), giving us F = 50000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 490,000 N. Step 2) As the load of the structure is uniformly distributed, the force on each column is this total force divided by four. This gives us the compressive force (f) on each column, f = F/4 = 490,000 N / 4 = 122,500 N. Step 3) The stress (\u03c3) exerted on each column is thus also this force value, \u03c3 = 122,500 N. Step 4) As given, the Young\u2019s modulus of steel (Y) is 2 x 10^11 Pa. Young\u2019s modulus is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand changes in length when under lengthwise tension or compression. It is the ratio of stress (\u03c3) to strain (\u03b5) in a material, Y = \u03c3 / \u03b5. From this definition, we can rearrange to get the value of strain as \u03b5 = \u03c3 / Y. Step 5) The strain can also be represented as \u03b5 = f/a / Y, where a is the cross-sectional area. Now we just need to find the cross-sectional area of the hollow cylindrical column. Step 6) Given that inner and outer radii of the column are 30 cm (or 0.3 m) and 60 cm (or 0.6 m) respectively, the area of the cylindrical column (A) is \u03c0(R^2\u2212r^2) where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius. So, A = \u03c0(0.6^2\u22120.3^2) = 0.27 \u03c0 m^2. Step 7) Substituting the values of f, a and Y back into the equation, the compressional strain (\u03b5) is found to be 122500 N / (0.27 * \u03c0 * 2 x 10^11 Pa) which results in  \u03b5 = 7.22 x 10^\u22127. Hence, the compressional strain of each column is 7.22 x 10^\u22127.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values from the problem: the mass (M) of the structure and the inner (r) and outer (R) radii of the columns. Step 2) Calculate the total force exerted on the columns, which is equal to the total weight of the structure (M x g). This uses the equation for weight, F = Mg. Step 3) As the load is uniformly distributed, find the compressive force on each column by dividing the total force by the number of columns, giving us the equation f = F/4. Step 4) We recognise that the stress on each column is equal to this force. Step 5) Using the known Young's modulus of steel (Y), we use the rearranged equation for Young's modulus to find the strain, \u03b5 = \u03c3 / Y, where \u03c3 is the stress. Step 6) We recognise the need to determine the cross-sectional area of the column to more directly calculate the strain. Using the formula for the area of a hollow cylinder, A = \u03c0(R^2\u2212r^2), calculate the area. Step 7) Substitute these values back into the equation for strain. The result is the compressional strain of each column."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, let's calculate the area of the cross-section of the copper piece. The cross-section is rectangular in shape and the dimensions provided are 15.2 mm \u00d7 19.1 mm. In order to keep our units consistent later when we plug values into the stress-strain equation, we need to convert these dimensions from millimeters to meters. We do this by multiplying each dimension by 10^(-3). Thus, the area of the cross-section, A, is calculated as 19.1 mm x 10^(-3) x 15.2 mm x 10^(-3) = 2.9 x 10^(-4) m^2. Step 2) From the problem, we know the force, F, exerted on the copper piece is 44,500 N. Step 3) The Modulus of Elasticity, Y, of copper (a constant that measures the stiffness of the material), is known as 42 x 10^9 Nm^(-2). Step 4) We will use the equation for the modulus of elasticity, Y = Stress / Strain, where Stress is the force per unit area (F/A). We can rearrange this equation to solve for Strain, which yields: Strain = F/(Y*A). Step 5) Now, we substitute the known values into the equation. Plugging in F = 44,500 N, A = 2.9 x 10^(-4) m^2, and Y = 42 x 10^9 Nm^(-2), we perform the calculation and find that Strain = 3.65 x 10^(-3).",

        "Question": "Q9. A steel cable with a radius of 1.5 cm supports a chairlift in a ski area. If the maximum stress is not to exceed 10^8 Nm^-2.What is the maximum load the cable can support?",
        "Original Solution": "Radius of the steel cable, r=1.5 cm = 0.015 m\r\nCross-sectional area of the cable = \u03c0r2= 3.14 x ( 0.015)^2\r\n= 7.06 x 10^-4 m\r\nMaximum stress allowed on the steel cable = 10^8 N/m^2\r\nMaximum load the cable can support = Maximum stress \u00d7 Area of cross-section\r\n= 108 x 7.06 x 10^-4\r\n= 7.065\u00d710^4 N\r\nHence, the cable can support the maximum load of 7.065\u00d710^4 N.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides us with the radius of the steel cable which is 1.5 cm. But as our final units need to be in Newtons (Nm^-2), we must convert the radius to meters. We know that 1 cm is equal to 0.01 m, so by multiplying 1.5 cm by 0.01, we get the radius in meters which is 0.015 m. This step is crucial to ensure consistency of units in all our calculations. Step 2) After we have the radius in appropriate units, we need to find out the cross-sectional area of the cable. We know that the area of a circle (which is the shape of the cross-section of the cable) is given by the formula Area = \u03c0r^2. Substituting our radius value into this equation, we get the area as \u03c0*(0.015)^2, which equals 7.06 x 10^-4 m^2. Step 3) Now that we have the area, we use the given information about the maximum allowed stress on the cable, which is 10^8 Nm^-2. Stress is defined as the force experienced per unit area. Step 4) We can now find the maximum load (force) that the cable can support. This can be calculated by rearranging the stress formula. The formula is Stress = Force/Area. Rearranging for Force gives us Force = Stress*Area. Substituting our values for stress and area into this formula, we get Force = (10^8)*(7.06 x 10^-4) which equals 7.065\u00d710^4 N. Therefore, the cable can support a maximum load of 7.065\u00d710^4 N.",

Step 4) Calculate the maximum load (force) that the cable can support by rearranging the formula for stress to solve for force, giving us Force = Stress*Area.

        "Question": "Q10. A rigid bar of mass 15 kg is supported symmetrically by three wires, each 2.0 m long. Those at each end are of copper, and the middle one is of iron. Determine the ratios of their diameters if each is to have the same tension.",
        "Original Solution": "As the tension on the wires is the same, the extension of each wire will also be the same. Now, as the length of the wires is the same, the strain on them will also be equal.\r\nNow, we know\r\nY = Stress / Strain\r\n= (F/A) / Strain  =  (4F/\u03c0d^2) / Strain     . . . . . . . . . .

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by recognizing a key fact: because the tension in the wires is the same, the extension of each wire (how much it stretches) will also be the same. This fact comes from the underlying physics principle that materials will deform in a directly proportional way to the force applied, provided the deformation is within elastic limits. This is the principle of Hooke's law. Step 2) Now, since all the wires have an identical length of 2.0 m, it follows that the strain on the wires (a measure of how much they have deformed, which is the deformation/original length) must also be equal. Step 3) We then use the defining formula for Young's modulus (Y), which is stress (force / area) divided by strain. This can be rewritten as (F/A) / strain, and substituting A as \u03c0d^2 /4 (where d is the diameter of the wire), it simplifies to (4F/\u03c0d^2) / strain. Step 4) From this equation (let's call it Equation 1), we deduce that Young's modulus, Y, is inversely proportional to the square of the wire's diameter (1/d^2). This implies that the diameter of the wire determines the amount of tension it can withstand to an extent. Step 5) We then use the Young's modulus values for iron and copper, given as 190 \u00d7 10^9 Pa and 120 \u00d7 10^9 Pa respectively. Let's denote the diameter of the iron wire as d1 and that of the copper wire as d2. Step 6) Then, we calculate the ratio of their diameters, which would give us the proportion of the diameters that ensures the tension in each wire is the same. This can be calculated as the square root of (190 \u00d7 10^9) / (120 \u00d7 10^9), which gives us 1.26. Thus, the ratio of the diameters of the iron wire to the copper wire is 1.26 to 1.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that because the tension in all wires is the same, the amount each wire stretches (extension) would also be the same. Step 2) Conclude that because all wire lengths are identical, the strain on each wire (deformation/original length) must also be equal. Step 3) Employ the formula for Young's modulus, which is Stress (Force/ Area) divided by Strain, re-written as (4F/\u03c0d^2) / Strain, Arrival at equation 1. Step 4) From equation 1, deduce that Young's modulus, Y, is inversely proportional to the square of the wire's diameter. This shows that the wire's diameter plays a role in determining the strain. Step 5) Use the values of Young's modulus for the iron and copper wires, which have different capacities to withstand tension. Label the diameter of the iron wire as d1 and the copper wire as d2. Step 6) Calculate the diameters ratio that will balance the tensions in the wires. This is calculated as the square root of the Young's Modulus of iron divided by the Young's Modulus of copper, and it results in a ratio of 1.26 : 1."

All these are given in the problem's text. Step 2) Determine the total pulling force (F) on the steel wire when the mass is at the lowest point of the vertical circle. This consists of the force due to gravity (mg) and the centripetal force due to the mass whirling in a circle (mr \u03c9^2). We use the equation F = mg + mr \u03c9^2 to calculate this. We then substitute the given values into our equation, and find that F = 14.5\u00d79.8+14.5\u00d71\u00d7(12.56)^2 = 2429.53 N.

To find the density of water at depth, we consider the depth as 'd', and denote the density at this depth as \u03c12.\nStep 2) We need to express the pressure at depth in a more convenient, scientific unit (Pascal). According to the conversion rate, we have: 1 atm = 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa. Thus, the given pressure, 80.0 atm, is equivalent to 80 \u00d7 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa. \nStep 3) Let's denote the volume of water of mass m at the surface as V1 and at the depth 'd' as V2. Consequently, the change in volume (\u0394V) can be defined as \u0394V = V1 \u2013 V2.\nStep 4) We can express the change in volume (\u0394V) as \u0394V = m [ (1/\u03c11) \u2013 (1/\u03c12) ], where \u03c11 and \u03c12 are densities at the surface and the depth respectively.\nStep 5) By dividing \u0394V by the original volume, we can calculate the volumetric strain: Volumetric strain = \u0394V / V1 = m [ (1/\u03c11) \u2013 (1/\u03c12) ] \u00d7 (\u03c11 / m). After simplification, we get: Volumetric strain = 1 \u2013 (\u03c11/\u03c12). \nStep 6) Now we consider an important property of liquids - their Bulk modulus (B), which can be calculated using the equation: B = pV1 / \u0394V. From this equation, we can derive an expression for \u0394V / V1 as p / B, where p is pressure, B is Bulk modulus and V1 is the original volume.\nStep 7) The inverse of Bulk Modulus is known as compressibility of the material. For water, this value is 45.8 \u00d7 10^(-11) Pa^(-1). Hence, by substituting the values of pressure and compressibility into the derived expression, we can calculate \u0394V / V1= 80 \u00d7 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 45.8 \u00d7 10^-11, which comes around 3.67 \u00d7 10^-3.\nStep 8) Finally, equating the expressions for Volumetric Strain and \u0394V / V1, we can solve for \u03c12 (density at depth). By rearranging and inputting known values, we get: \u03c12 = 1.03 \u00d7 10^3 / [ 1 \u2013 3.67 \u00d7 10^-3], which gives us the final answer: \u03c12 = 1.068 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^\u20133. This is the water density at the given depth.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given that the pressure acting on the glass slab, p is 10 atmospheric pressure. This unit of pressure is usually converted to a more standard unit, Pascal (Pa). This is done because using standard units eases calculations and comparisons. So, we convert 10 atm into Pascal using the relation 1 atm = 1.013 x 10^5 Pa, yielding p = 10 x 1.013 x 10^5 Pa. Step 2) Next, we recall that the bulk modulus of glass, denoted as 'B', is a measure of its resistance to uniform compression. The bulk modulus for glass is given to us as 37 x 10^9 Nm^\u20132.

This equation provides the method to calculate the volume change ratio under certain pressure applied. Step 5) We then plug the known values into this equation and solve: \u2206V/V = [10 x 1.013 x 10^5] / (37 x 10^9). The result is \u2206V/V = 2.73 x 10^ -4.

Step 2) In order to find the volume of the cube, we use the formula for the volume of a cube, which is V = a^3. Given that 'a' is in centimeters, we have to convert it to meters by dividing its value by 100 (10/100 = 0.1 m) because in the SI unit system, we denote length in meters. Step 3) After conversion, the volume of the cube is calculated to be (0.1 m)^3 = 0.001 m^3. Step 4) We are also given that the hydraulic pressure 'P' applied to the cube is 7.0 x 10^6 Pa, and the bulk modulus 'K' of the copper that the cube is made of is 140 x 10^9 Pa.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Note down the provided information and establish the known parameters. We know that the volume of water, V=1 litre, and that it should be compressed by 0.10%. In this context, 'compressing' means decreasing the volume, and we are dealing with a physical change that will require force or pressure to achieve. So our goal is to find the pressure needed to create this physical change. Step 2) Next, let's determine the fractional change in volume, denoted as \u25b3V/V. This is computed by the percentage divided by 100. In our case, that's (0.1/100)\u00d71, which equals to 0.001 or 10^(-3). The fractional change represents the desired decrease in volume in relation to the original volume. Step 3) Now, let's recap the concept of Bulk modulus, B. This is a material property defined as the ratio of pressure (p) to the fractional volume change (\u25b3V/V). The formula for this is B = P/(\u25b3V/V) or rearranged it becomes P = B\u00d7(\u25b3V/V). This will be useful for finding the pressure in the following steps. Step 4) Use the known Bulk modulus of water, which is B = 2.2\u00d710^9 Nm^\u22122. This value is experimentally determined and commonly used. The units Nm^\u22122 are the same as Pascals, Pa, the unit we'll use for the pressure. Step 5) Lastly, plug the values into the formula determined in step 3: P = B\u00d7(\u25b3V/V).

Assume that each rivet is to carry one-quarter of the load.",
        "Original Solution": "Diameter of the metal strips= 6mm = 6 x  10^-3 m\r\nRadius, r = 3 x 10^-3 m;\r\nShearing stress on the rivet= 6.9 x 10^7 Pa\r\nMaximum load or force on a rivet\r\n= Maximum stress x cross-sectional area\r\n= 6.9 x 10^7 x 3.14 x (3 x 10^-3)^2 N = 1950 N\r\nMaximum tension = 4 x 1950 N = 7800 N",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by observing that the diameter of the metal strips is given to us as 6mm. Convert this measurement to meters by multiplying it by 10^-3, as one meter is equivalent to 1000mm. This would mean the diameter is 6 x 10^-3 m. Step 2) Knowing the diameter allows us to determine the radius, which is half of the diameter. Therefore, the radius r is 3 x 10^-3 m. Step 3) We are told that the shearing stress on the rivet is 6.9 x 10^7 Pa, we don't need to convert this as it is already in the standard SI unit. Step 4) To find the maximum load or force that a single rivet can carry, we multiply the shearing stress by the cross-sectional area of the rivet. The formula for cross-sectional area of a circle is \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. We plug in the radius we found earlier to perform this calculation, yielding a force of 6.9 x 10^7 x 3.14 x (3 x 10^-3)^2 N, which is approximately to 1950 N. This is the force a single rivet can carry. Step 5) However, the problem states that each rivet carries a quarter of the load, implying the existence of four rivets.

We also take note that the objective is to find the change in volume of the ball, which we\u2019ll symbolize as \u0394V. \n\nStep 2) We need to use the formula related to the concepts of pressure, volume, and Bulk Modulus.

        "Original Solution": "(a). The blood column to the feet is at a greater height than the head. Thus, the blood pressure in the feet is greater than that in the brain.\r\n(b). The density of the atmosphere does not decrease linearly with the increase in altitude, in fact, most of the air molecules are close to the surface. Thus, there is this nonlinear variation of atmospheric pressure.\r\n(c). In hydrostatic pressure, the force is transmitted equally in all directions in the liquid; thus, there is no fixed direction of pressure, making it a scalar quantity.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that blood pressure varies in the body due to gravitational force. Gravity pulls the blood downwards, causing enhanced pressure at locations lower than the heart. When you stand up, the blood column to your feet is greater in height than the blood column to your brain. This height difference creates a pressure variation. Thus, the blood pressure in your feet is greater than that in your brain. \n\nStep 2) For part (b), first recall the properties of the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is highly dense near the surface and the density of the atmosphere decreases with an increase in altitude. This means that the majority of air molecules are found closer to the Earth's surface. It's also important to note that atmospheric pressure is directly proportional to the density of the air molecules present. Since the density does not decrease linearly with the increase in altitude, there is also a nonlinear decrease in the atmospheric pressure. Hence, at a height of about 6 km, the atmospheric pressure decreases to nearly half of its value at sea level despite the height of the atmosphere being more than 100 km.\n\nStep 3) For part (c), remember what hydrostatic pressure refers to. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest due to the force of gravity. It's worth noting that pressure is defined as force per unit area. Despite this definition, hydrostatic pressure is still classified as a scalar quantity and not a vector quantity. This is because in a fluid at rest, the pressure force is transmitted equally in every direction. Thus, there is no specific direction for the pressure force; this lack of a fixed direction is essentially what makes hydrostatic pressure a scalar quantity.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the concept that blood pressure in humans varies based on the height of the blood column in relation to the position of the heart. This height variation is caused by the effects of gravity, resulting in higher pressure at the feet than at the brain.\n\nStep 2) Recall the characteristics of Earth's atmosphere in relation to part (b). Atmospheric pressure decreases nonlinearly with an increase in altitude due to the highly dense nature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface. This results in the atmosphere's pressure being half its value at about 6 km altitude, despite the atmosphere's total height being over 100 km.\n\nStep 3) Understand hydrostatic pressure for part (c). Despite the fact that pressure is defined as force per unit area, hydrostatic pressure is actually a scalar quantity. This is due to the pressure force in a fluid at rest being distributed equally in all directions, meaning that it has no specific direction, resulting in the pressure being classified as a scalar quantity."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with statement (a). The surface tension of liquids generally decreases with temperature. Imagine a pan of water on a hot stove; as the water becomes hotter (its temperature increases), it begins to boil, breaking the surface tension that held the molecules together. So, the correct word to fill the blank is 'decreases'. Step 2) Moving on to statement (b), the first part of the sentence deals with gases. As the temperature of a gas increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases, causing the molecules to bump into each other more frequently and with more force. This results in an increased resistance to flow, or what is commonly known as an increase in viscosity. So, the correct word for the first blank is 'increases'. When it comes to liquids, it's a bit of a different story. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also increases, but this allows the molecules to slide past each other more easily, effectively decreasing the resistance to flow, or viscosity. Therefore, the correct word to fill the second blank is 'decreases'. Step 3) Statement (c) discusses the shearing force for solids and fluids. In solids, the shearing force is proportional to the shear strain i.e., the deformation of the solid under the applied force. But in the case of fluids, the shearing force is proportional to the rate of shear strain as it indicates not just the amount of deformation, but how that deformation changes with time. Thus, the words to fill in the blanks are 'shear strain' and 'rate of shear strain' respectively. Step 4) Now, let's take a look at statement (d). The behavior of a fluid in a steady flow at a point of constriction follows the conservation of mass, and more complexly, Bernoulli\u2019s principle. According to Bernoulli\u2019s principle, an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or decrease in the fluid's potential energy. So, the correct phrases to fill in the blank are 'conservation of mass' and 'Bernoulli\u2019s principle'. Step 5) Lastly, statement (e) talks about turbulence in a wind tunnel. Turbulence at such a contained and small scale will occur at a greater speed in comparison to a full-scale, real-world scenario because the model of a plane in the wind tunnel is much smaller and hence requires greater speed to replicate the same conditions as an actual plane. Thus, the correct word to fill in the blank is 'greater'.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) In statement (a), the surface tension of liquids decreases with temperature. Step 2) In statement (b), the viscosity of gases increases with temperature and the viscosity of liquids decreases with temperature due to the changes in molecular kinetic energy. Step 3) In statement (c), the shearing force for solids is proportional to shear strain and for fluids it is proportional to the rate of shear strain. Step 4) In statement (d), fluid behavior at constrictions follows the conservation of mass and Bernoulli\u2019s principle.

As the K.E. of air above the paper increases, in accordance with Bernoulli\u2019s theorem, its pressure energy and hence, its pressure decreases.\r\nDue to the greater value of pressure below the piece of paper = atmospheric pressure, it remains horizontal and does not fall.\r\n(b) As per the equation of continuity, area \u00d7 velocity = constant. When we try to close a water tap with our fingers, the area of the cross-section of the outlet of the water jet is reduced considerably, as the openings between our fingers provide constriction (regions of smaller area).\r\nThus, the velocity of the water increases greatly, and fast jets of water come through the openings between our fingers.\r\n(c) The size of the needle controls the velocity of flow, and the thumb pressure controls pressure.  According to the Bernoulli\u2019s theorem  P + \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } pv^{ 2 }\\end{array} \\) = Constant\r\nIn this equation, the pressure P occurs with a single power, whereas the velocity occurs with a square power. Therefore, the velocity is more effective compared to the pressure. It is for this reason that the needle of the syringe controls the flow rate better than the thumb pressure exerted by the doctor.\r\n(d) This is because of the principle of conservation of momentum. While the flowing fluid carries forward momentum, the vessel gets a backward momentum.(e) A spinning cricket ball would have followed a parabolic trajectory had there been no air. But because of air, the Magnus effect takes place. Due to the Magnus effect, the spinning cricket ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start with part (a) of the question. Here we're asked to explain why we should blow over, rather than under, a piece of paper to keep it horizontal. The reason lies in the Bernoulli\u2019s Theorem, which states that as the velocity of the air increases, its pressure decreases. By blowing over the paper, we enhance the speed of the air above the paper, reducing the pressure there. Meanwhile, the pressure beneath the paper remains equivalent to the atmospheric pressure, hence creating a pressure differential that keeps the paper horizontal. \nStep 2) Moving on to part (b), it concerns the phenomenon when we attempt to close a water tap with our fingers. Here, we need to understand the principle of the equation of continuity that asserts the product of the area and velocity is constant within a fluid flow. When we decrease the area by covering the water tap with our fingers, essentially it increases the velocity of the water leading to gushing jets through the spaces between our fingers. \nStep 3) Part (c) regards the role of the needle's size in a syringe and the thumb pressure exerted by the doctor in dictating the flow rate. The mathematical base of the explanation here again relies on the Bernoulli\u2019s theorem. As mentioned before, Bernoulli\u2019s theorem encompasses an equation which involves the pressure P and the velocity v squared, denoted by v^2. In this equation, the effect of velocity is more pronounced due to the square power, indicating minor changes in velocity impact the flow rate more than pressure. Hence, the needle\u2019s size has a greater effect on the flow rate than the thumb pressure exerted by the doctor.\nStep 4) In part (d), the principle of conservation of momentum allows us to explain why a fluid flowing out from a small hole in a vessel results in a backward thrust on the vessel. As the fluid moves forward carrying its momentum, an equal and opposite momentum (backward thrust) is imparted onto the vessel to conserve the total momentum.\nStep 5) Finally, in part (e), we must explain why a spinning cricket ball does not follow a parabolic trajectory. In vacuum conditions, the ball would indeed follow a parabolic path. However, the presence of air introduces a factor known as the Magnus effect. Because of the spinning motion, different air velocity is developed on different faces of the ball causing a pressure differential which deviates the ball from its anticipated parabolic path.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) For part (a), use Bernoulli's theorem. Increased velocity leads to decreased pressure, keeping the paper horizontal when we blow over it.\nStep 2) In part (b), apply the principle of continuity, stating that reducing the area of flow increases the velocity, resulting in jets of water shooting out between our fingers.\nStep 3) For part (c), refer again to Bernoulli\u2019s theorem. With the pressure and the square of the velocity involved in the equation, the size of the needle affecting the velocity has more impact on the flow rate compared to the thumb pressure.\nStep 4) In part (d), use the principle of conservation of momentum. As fluid flows out of a vessel carrying momentum, backward momentum (equal and opposite) is imparted onto the vessel.\nStep 5) Lastly, for part (e), invoke the theory of the Magnus effect, which due to air presence, deflects a spinning cricket ball from its parabolic trajectory."

        "Question": "5: A 50 kg girl wearing high heel shoes balances on a single heel. The heel is circular with a diameter of 1.0 cm. What is the pressure exerted by the heel on the horizontal floor? \r\n",
        "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nRadius of the heel, r = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ d }{ 2 }\\end{array} \\) = 0.005 m\r\nMass of the lady, m = 50 kg\r\nArea of the heel, A = \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0 (0.005)^2= 7.85 \u00d7 10^(-5) m^2\r\nForce on the floor due to the heel, F = mg = 50 \u00d7 9.8 = 490 N\r\nThe pressure exerted by the heel on the floor,\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ F }{ A }\\end{array} \\)  = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 490 }{  7.85 \\times  10^{ -5 }}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}6.24 \\times 10^{ 6 }\\end{array} \\) Nm^(-2)",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the values provided by the problem. We know that the lady's mass (m) is 50 kg, her heel is circular with a diameter of 1.0 cm, and we know the acceleration due to gravity (g) is always approximately 9.8 m/s^2. \n\nStep 2) We start with the radius (r) of the heel, which is not directly given. Since we are given the diameter (d) and radius is half the diameter, we use the formula r = d/2. Here, diameter is 1.0 cm which we convert to meters (noting the 100 cm = 1 m conversion), giving r = 0.005 m.\n\nStep 3) Next, we calculate the area (A) of the circular heel. The formula is A = \u03c0r^2. Here radius (r) is 0.005 m, so, A = \u03c0 (0.005)^2 = 7.85 x 10^(-5) m^2. This gives us the area in square meters.\n\nStep 4) Now we calculate the force (F) exerted by the lady on the ground. Since all her weight is on the heel, that gives us a force calculated by multiplying her mass (m) by the acceleration due to gravity (g). That is, F = mg = 50 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 490 N (Newtons).\n\nStep 5) Finally, we find the pressure (P) exerted by the heel. Pressure is force per unit area, P = F/A. We substitute the values of F and A from the previous steps to find the pressure. P = 490 N / 7.85 x 10^(-5) m^2 = 6.24 x 10^6 N/m^2 (Pascal) extended by heel on the floor.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, it is necessary to list all the given values in the problem for clarity. For the Toricelli\u2019s barometer that used mercury, the density is 13.6 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3 and the column height is 0.76 meters. For Pascal\u2019s barometer that used French wine, we know that the density is 984 kg/m^3 and we are asked to find the height. The acceleration due to gravity is typically at 9.8 m/s^2. Step 2) We then leverage the fact that the pressure generated by the column of liquid in each barometer is equal because they are both experiencing normal atmospheric pressure. Given this, we can equate the pressures: the pressure in the mercury column (\u03c11h1g) is equal to the pressure in the wine column (\u03c12h2g). Here, \u03c1 represents the density of the substance, h represents the height of the column, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Step 3) We then rearrange the equation for h2, which represents the height of the French wine column. That gives us h2 = \u03c11h1 / \u03c12. This equation states that the unknown height of the wine column can be calculated by multiplying the density and height of the mercury column, and then dividing by the given density of the wine. Step 4) Next, we substitute the known values into the equation. That is, we replace \u03c11 with 13.6 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3, h1 with 0.76 m, and \u03c12 with 984 kg/m^3. Solving this gives us h2 = 10.5 m. This is the expected height of the wine column under normal atmospheric pressure.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) List the known densities, heights, and gravity values for both the mercury and wine barometers. Step 2) Understand that the pressures in both columns are equal, as both are under normal atmospheric pressure, leading to \u03c11h1g = \u03c12h2g, where \u03c1 represents density, h represents height, and g is gravity. Step 3) Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown, which is the height of the wine column (h2), giving us h2 = \u03c11h1 / \u03c12. Step 4) Substitute known values into the equation for h2, which results in h2 = 10.5 meters. We now know the height of the wine column when subjected to normal atmospheric pressure."

        "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nThe maximum stress the structure can handle, P = 10^9 Pa\r\nDepth of the sea, d = 3 km = 3 \u00d7 10^3 m  Density of water, \u03c1 = 10^3 kg/m^3\r\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m/s^2\r\nWe know\r\nThe pressure exerted by the seawater at depth, d = \u03c1dg = 10^3 x 3 \u00d7 10^3 \u00d7 9.8 = 2.94 \u00d7 10^7 Pa\r\nAs the sea exerts a pressure lesser than the maximum stress the structure can handle, the structure can survive on the oil well in the sea.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given a few pieces of information to begin with. First, we've been told the maximum stress that the offshore structure can endure is 109 Pa. That is, P = 10^9 Pa. Second, we know the depth of the sea where the structure is proposed to be installed is 3km or 3 \u00d7 10^3 m. Additionally, we're given the density of seawater \u03c1 = 10^3 kg/m^3 and the acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m/s^2. Step 2) The next step is understanding the physics involved. The pressure exerted by the seawater at depth, d, is calculated by the formula \u03c1dg. We substitute the given values in the equation, which yields 10^3 x 3 \u00d7 10^3 x 9.8; this calculates to 2.94 \u00d7 10^7 Pa. Step 3) Finally, we compare the pressure exerted by the sea to the maximum stress the structure can handle. If the pressure is lesser, then the structure can withstand the conditions of the sea. We find that 2.94 \u00d7 10^7 Pa (pressure from seawater) is less than 10^9 Pa (maximum stress the structure can take), thus concluding that the structure is indeed suitable for installation on an oil well in the ocean.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values - maximum stress the structure can handle (P = 10^9 Pa), depth of the sea (d = 3 \u00d7 10^3 m), density of seawater (\u03c1 = 10^3 kg/m^3), and acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s^2). Step 2) Apply these values to the formula for calculating the pressure exerted by the seawater at a certain depth, which is \u03c1dg. This formula helps determine if the pressure at that depth will exceed the maximum stress the structure can tolerate. Step 3) Compare the calculated pressure to the maximum stress the structure can handle. If the pressure is lesser, then the structure can withstand the conditions of the sea. The comparison shows whether the offshore structure can safely be installed over the oil well in the ocean."

Therefore, the maximum pressure on the smaller is 6.917 \u00d7 10^5 Pa",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step in solving this problem is to identify the known values from the question. From the problem's statement, we know the maximum mass that the lift can carry (m) is 3000 kg and the area of the cross-section of the piston lifting the weight (A) is 425 cm^2. Step 2) We must convert the area from square centimeters to square meters, as the standard SI unit for area in physics is m^2. This can be done using the conversion factor of 1 m^2 = 10^4 cm^2, giving A = 425 \u00d7 10^-4 m^2. Step 3) We use the equation for force (F = mg), where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity, to calculate the maximum force the lift has to bear. Here, g is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. Plugging the given mass into the equation, we get F = 3000 x 9.8 = 29400 N. This step gives us the maximum force exerted by the load. Step 4) We then use the equation for pressure (P = F / A) to find out the maximum pressure on the piston. By substituting the force and area identified above, we calculate P =  29400/(425 \u00d7 10^-4)  = 6.917 x 10^5 Pa. The principle that pressure in a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions allows us to state that this will also be the maximum pressure on the smaller piston.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values for mass (m = 3000 kg) and cross-sectional area (A = 425 cm^2) of the piston. Step 2) Convert the area from cm^2 to m^2 because m^2 is the standard unit for area in physics. We use the conversion factor 1 m^2 = 10^4 cm^2, so A = 425 \u00d7 10^-4 m^2. Step 3) Use the equation of force (F = mg) to find the maximum force. This equation embodies the concept of weight as a force, with m as mass and g as the acceleration due to gravity (~9.8 m/s^2). This gives us F = 3000 x 9.8 = 29400 N. Step 4) Use the pressure equation (P = F / A) to compute for the maximum pressure on the piston. This equation implies that pressure is the force distributed over an area. Substituting our computed force and converted area into this equation yields the maximum pressure. Because of the principle of liquid pressure being transmitted equally in all directions, this calculated maximum pressure also applies to the smaller piston."

        "Original Solution": "No, it does not matter if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressures in applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation, provided the atmospheric pressure at the two points where Bernoulli\u2019s equation applied to the system is significantly different.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with addressing the concept of pressure, specifically the two types of pressure in question - gauge and absolute pressure. Gauge pressure is the pressure measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, whereas absolute pressure is the pressure measured with respect to a perfect vacuum (zero pressure) Step 2) We then bring into focus Bernoulli's equation which is essentially a statement of the conservation of energy principle for flowing fluids. It accounts for gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, and fluid pressure. Step 3) To answer the question as to whether it matters if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressure in applying Bernoulli's equation, we should recall that Bernoulli's equation is generally applied between two points within a fluid flow where pressure, velocity, and elevation might be different, but where the sum of their contributions to the total energy of the fluid remains constant. Step 4) In applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation, as long as the pressure difference between the two points is the same, the equation holds, regardless of whether the pressures used are gauge or absolute. If the atmospheric pressure is the same at both points, the gauge pressures and absolute pressures will differ by a constant value (the value of the atmospheric pressure) at both points, so the pressure difference remains the same. Step 5) Hence, it follows that it does not matter if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressures in applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation, provided the atmospheric pressure at the two points where the equation is applied remain the same. This is because the change in pressure, which is what's important in Bernoulli's equation, is independent of whether gauge or absolute pressures are used.",

The sum of their contributions to the total energy does not change. Step 4) Understand that gauge and absolute pressures at both points will differ by a constant value (atmospheric pressure), therefore maintaining a constant pressure difference regardless of the type of pressure used.

If an air bubble of the same dimension were formed at a depth of 40.0 cm inside a container containing the soap solution (of relative density 1.20), what would be the pressure inside the bubble? (1 atmospheric pressure is 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa)",
        "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nSurface tension of the soap solution, S = 2.50 \u00d7 10^(-2) N/m r = 5.00 mm = 5 \u00d7 10^(-3) m\r\nDensity of the soap solution, \u03c1 = 1.2 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3  Relative density of the soap solution = 1.20 \r\nAir bubble is at a depth, h = 30 cm = 0.3 m\r\nRadius of the air bubble, r = 4 mm = 5\u00d7 10^(-3) m\r\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m/s^2      1 atmospheric pressure = 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa We know;\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 4S } { r }\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left (\\frac{ 4 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{ -2 } }{ 5 \\times 10^{ -3 } } \\right )\\end{array} \\) = 20 Pa\r\nThus, the excess pressure inside the soap bubble is 20 Pa.Now, for the excess pressure inside the air bubble, P\u2019 = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 2S }{ r }\\end{array} \\)\r\nP\u2019 = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left (\\frac{ 2 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{ -2 } }{ 5 \\times 10^{ -3 } } \\right )\\end{array} \\) = 10 Pa\r\nThus, the excess pressure inside the air bubble is 10 Pa.\r\nAt a depth of 0.4 m, the total pressure inside the air bubble = Atmospheric pressure + h\u03c1g + P\u2019\r\n= 1.01 x 10^5 + 0.4 x 1.2 x 10^3 x 9.8 + 10= 1.06 x 10^5 Pa.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's identify the knowns that are given in the problem: the surface tension of the soap solution (S) is 2.50 x 10^-2 N/m, the radius of the bubble (r) is 5.00 mm or 5 x 10^-3 m, the relative density of the soap solution is 1.20 (which implies that the density, \u03c1, is 1.2 x 10^3 kg/m^3 as relative density is the ratio to the density of water), and an air bubble is at a depth, h, of 30 cm or 0.3 m., \n\nStep 2) We will also use established physics constants: the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s^2, and 1 atmospheric pressure is 1.01 x 10^5 Pa., \n\nStep 3) We will first solve for the excess pressure inside the soap bubble. For this, we use the equation for pressure inside a soap bubble, which is P = 4S/r, where S is the surface tension and r is the radius. This equation comes from the physics of surface tension where pressure inside a bubble is directly proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the radius of the bubble., \n\nStep 4) Now, we substitute our known values into the equation: P = 4*(2.5*10^-2)/(5*10^-3) which gives us P = 20 Pa.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by understanding the information given. The area of the hinged door 'a' is stated to be 20 cm^2. However, to keep units consistent with those typically used in physics, we should convert this to m^2. This gives us 20 x 10^-4 m^2. We also know that the base area of the tank 'A' is 1.0 m^2, that the density of water '\u03c11' is 10^3 kg/m^3, the density of the acid '\u03c12' is 1.7 x 10^3 kg/m^3, and that both the water and the acid are at a height 'h' of 4 m. The acceleration due to gravity 'g' is always 9.8 ms^-2. Step 2) Once we have established these variables, we can compute the pressure exerted by both the water and the acid, using the formula for pressure P = h\u03c1g. So the pressure exerted by water or P1 = h1\u03c11g, which calculates to 4 x 10^3 x 9.8 = 3.92 x 10^4 Pa. The pressure exerted by the acid or P2 = h2\u03c12g, which calculates to 4 x 1.7 x 10^3 x 9.8 = 6.664 x 10^4 Pa. Step 3) From these, we can calculate the pressure difference between the two compartments of the tank, \u0394P = P2 - P1 = (6.664 - 3.92) X 10^4= 2.744 x 10^4Pa. Step 4) Remember that force is in a sense just 'concentrated' pressure and is calculated as the product of pressure and area. Thus, to keep the door from opening due to this pressure difference, the force exerted on the door must be exactly equal to this pressure difference times the area of the door, F = \u0394P x a. This gives us 2.744 x 10^4 x 20 x 10^-4 = 54.88N. Thus, we find that the force necessary to keep the door closed is 54.88N.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify and convert if necessary the given values into the appropriate units for the area of the door 'a', the tank area 'A', the densities of water '\u03c11' and acid '\u03c12', the heights of the water and the acid 'h', and the acceleration due to gravity 'g'. Step 2) Using the formula for pressure P = h\u03c1g, compute the pressures exerted by the water 'P1' and the acid 'P2'. Step 3) Calculating the pressure difference \u0394P between the two compartments, \u0394P = P2 - P1. Step 4) Lastly, find the force required to keep the door closed, which is equal to the pressure difference multiplied by the area of the door, F = \u0394P x a.

        "Question": "23: Two vessels have the same base area but different shapes. The first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel requires to fill up to a particular common height. Is the force exerted by the water on the base of the vessel the same in the two cases? If so, why do the vessels filled with water to that same height give different readings on a weighing scale?",
        "Original Solution": "As the base area is the same as the pressure, the force acting on the two vessels will also be the same. However, force is also exerted on the walls of the vessel, which have a nonvertical component when the walls are not perpendicular to the base. The net non-vertical component on the sides of the vessel is lesser for the second vessel than the first.  Therefore, the vessels have different weights despite having the same force on the base.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's first understand the given information. We have two vessels with the same base area, but different shapes. When they are filled up to the same height, the first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel takes. The question is whether the force exerted by the water on the base of both vessels is the same. Step 2) Remember that pressure at a point in a fluid is equal to the height of the fluid column above that point multiplied by the fluid's density and the gravitational acceleration. This means that the pressure at the bottom of both vessels is the same because the height of the water, the water's density, and gravity are the same in both vessels. Step 3) Pressure is force per unit area. Since the pressure at the base of both vessels is the same, and the area is also the same (as given), the force (which is pressure times area) must also be the same. Step 4) Now, the question also asks why there are different readings on a weighing scale when the two vessels are filled with water. While the pressure at the base of the vessel depends only on the height of the water, the weight of the water in the vessel depends on the total volume of the water, which is different in the vessels because of their different shapes. Step 5) Moreover, the force exerted by the water on the sides of the vessel is nonvertical. These forces have horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal components cancel out, while the vertical components add up to the weight of the water. The slanting shapes of the vessels mean that the second vessel has lesser vertical component forces on its sides compared to the first vessel, hence presenting different readings on the weighing scale.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that we have two vessels with the same base area but different shapes. When filled to the same height, the first vessel takes twice the volume of water as the second. Step 2) Recall that pressure in a fluid is equal to the height of the fluid column times the fluid's density and gravitational acceleration, leading to the same pressure at the base of both vessels because they're filled to the same height. Step 3) As pressure is force per unit area and both pressure and area are the same for both vessels, the force (pressure times area) must also be equal. Step 4) The difference in weight readings on a scale occurs because the weight of the water depends on the total volume of water, which is different for each vessel. Step 5) Additionally, the force exerted by the water on the side walls of each vessel differs because of the vessels' different shapes, contributing to the difference in weight readings on the scale."

        "Original Solution": "(a) If dissipative forces are present, then some forces in liquid flow due to pressure difference is spent against dissipative forces, due to which the pressure drop becomes large.\r\n(b) The dissipative forces become more important with increasing flow velocity because of turbulence.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, we analyze the problem and consider the given values. The diameter of the artery is given as 2 \u00d7 10^\u20133 m, and we are asked to determine the largest average velocity of blood flow in the artery. Even though no further numbers are given, our problem is implying that there is a relationship between the diameter of an artery and its maximum average blood velocity for laminar flow. Step 2) When dealing with fluid dynamics, it is crucial to understand the properties of the fluid and the type of flow - in this case, the fluid is blood and the flow is assumed to be laminar. When the flow is laminar, it means it's 'smooth', without cross-currents or turbulence. However, as the velocity of the blood flow increases, the forces against the laminar flow (dissipative forces) also increase, which may cause the flow to become turbulent. Step 3) This leads to the realization that the largest average velocity for blood flow will be the velocity right before the blood flow becomes turbulent from the increasing dissipative forces. Step 4) To answer the second part of the problem, we think about what happens when the velocity increases even more. As the velocity further increases, the flow becomes turbulent and dissipative forces overcome the pressure differences driving the flow. Therefore, yes, the dissipative forces do become more important as the fluid velocity increases. This is due to the nature of turbulence, which is chaotic and full of cross-currents and eddies, leading to much higher resistance against the flow.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We begin by setting up the problem, noting the given diameter of the artery and the requirement to find the maximum average velocity for blood flow under laminar conditions. Step 2) We discuss the properties of fluid flow, focusing on the definition of laminar flow and how it relates to the properties of blood as a fluid. Step 3) This leads us to the concept that our maximum average velocity would be the velocity right before the flow switches from laminar to turbulent due to increasing dissipative forces. Step 4) To answer the second part of the problem, we discuss the impact of increased velocity, which strengthens the dissipative forces and leads to a transition into turbulent flow. This demonstrates that dissipative forces indeed become more important as fluid velocity increases."

So the maximum average velocity for laminar flow in an artery of this size carrying blood of this viscosity is approximately 0.983 m/s. \\nStep 6) Now, to find the flow rate, we will use the equation R = VAVG * \u03c0 * r^2. This describes how much fluid flows per unit time (flow rate), given its velocity and the cross-sectional area of the location where it's flowing (a circle of radius r). \\nStep 7) Substituting the known values into the equation, the flow rate R = 0.983 * 3.14 * (2 \u00d7 10^-3)^2 = 1.235 x 10^-6 m^3/s. This is the maximum flow rate under laminar conditions for the artery.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by assimilating the known information. We know that the total area of the wings (accounting for both wings) A of the plane is equal to 2 x 25 m^2, or 50 m^2. This is a simple multiplication of the given wing area by 2 as there are two wings on the plane. Step 2) Next, we convert the speed of air over the lower and upper wing surfaces from km/h to m/s, as it's easier to work with SI units. For the lower wing, V1 = 180 km/h = 180 x (5/18) = 50 m/s. For the upper wing, V2 = 234 km/h = 234 x (5/18) = 65 m/s. We achieve these conversions by a standard factor of 5/18 that translates speed from km/h to m/s. Step 3) Now, we assume the pressure of air over the lower wing to be P1, and over the upper wing to be P2. Their pressure difference \u0394P forms the basis of the difference in lift on either wing surface. Although we don't directly know the values of P1 and P2, we know that \u0394P can be calculated using the formula \u0394P = (1/2) \u03c1 (V2^2 \u2013 V1^2), where \u03c1 is the known density of air, which in this case is 1 kg/m^3. Step 4) Plugging known values, we get \u0394P = (1/2) x 1 x (65^2 \u2013 50^2) = 862.5 Pa. Step 5) We then calculate the net upward force F=\u0394P x A. This is calculated by formula from fluid dynamics, where the net upwards force resulting from difference in air pressure across a surface is given by the product of the pressure difference and the area. Step 6) The plane is in level flight at a constant speed. This implies that the net upward force must balance the weight of the plane, hence we set mg, where m is the plane's mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity, equal to \u0394P x A. Rearranging the equation to solve for m, we get m = (\u0394P x A) / g. Step 7) Substituting the known values, we get m = (862.5 x 50) / 9.8\u200b, which simplifies to m =4400 kg.

This assumption simplifies our calculations by taking out factors that would typically counteract the drop's downward motion. Step 2) We use the formula for terminal velocity, v = 2 r^2 g \u03c1 / (9 \u03b7), which can be derived from first principles by balancing the forces of gravity and the drag force from the oil drop in air at terminal velocity. These forces are equal at terminal velocity because the velocity is constant, and thus, there is no acceleration.

Mathematically, this is expressed as d\u03c1/dy = - \u03c1/y0. The negative sign signifies that as y (height) increases, \u03c1 (density) decreases. y0 here is the characteristic height, or the height at which the density reduces to 1/e (approximately 0.3679) of its original value. \n\nStep 2) Next, note that this is a first-order differential equation in \u03c1. To solve such differential equations, we can separate variables and integrate. In this case, we integrate the expression d\u03c1/\u03c1 from \u03c10 (density at sea level) to \u03c1 (density at height y) and dy/y0 from 0 (sea level) to y (the height where density \u03c1 is measured). \n\nStep 3) After integration, we have [loge \u03c1] evaluated from \u03c10 to \u03c1 = -(y/y0).

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We're given two absolute scales, A and B, with defined triple points of water at 200 A and 350 B, respectively. In the context of temperature, the triple point of water is the unique temperature at which ice, water, and steam can coexist. This point is an exact measure on any temperature scale, and it serves as a useful conversion point between scales.\n\nStep 2) The problem gives us the temperatures for the triple points on each absolute scale: T1 = 200 A for scale A, and T2 = 350 B for scale B. However, we also learn that the triple point on the Kelvin scale, TK, is set at 273.15 K. \n\nStep 3) The next step is to find a conversion factor for each scale so that we can relate them to each other. We start by noting that 200 A is equivalent to 273.15 K, thus giving us the equation 200 A = 273.15 K. Rearranging this to solve for A, we have A = 273.15 K / 200 = 1.36575 K/A.\n\nStep 4) Likewise, we note that 350 B equals to 273.15 K, thus B, calculated in the same way, equals to 273.15 K / 350 = 0.78042 K/B.\n\nStep 5) Now that we know how to convert temperature from absolute scales A and B to Kelvin, we can relate the temperature TA on scale A to the temperature TB on scale B. We do this through the following equation: 273.15 * TA / 200 = 273.15 * TB / 350. The respective coefficients of TA and TB result from replacing the value of A and B derived from steps 3 and 4.\n\nStep 6) Simplifying this equation, it yields TA : TB = 4 : 7. This is the relationship between temperature given on scales A and B, and it's the answer to the problem.",

We're given the triple point temperatures on two absolute scales A and B.\n\nStep 2) Notice that the problem gives us the triple-point temperatures both in terms of Kelvin and of scales A and B. \n\nStep 3) Find the conversion factors for scales A and B by setting the given temperatures equal to the known Kelvin triple point temperature and solving for A and B. \n\nStep 4) With the conversion factors, we can relate temperature measurement on the A scale to that on the B scale by setting their equivalent temperatures in Kelvin equal to each other.\n\nStep 5) Simplify the resulting equation to find the relationship between temperatures TA and TB on scales A and B, respectively."

        "Question": "Q.4: Answer the following.\r\n(a) The triple-point of water is a standard fixed point in a modern thermometer. Why? What is wrong with taking the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water as standard fixed points (as was originally done in the Celsius scale)?\r\n(b) There were two fixed points in the original Celsius scale, as mentioned above, which were assigned the numbers 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, respectively. On the absolute scale, one of the fixed points is the triple-point of water, which on the Kelvin absolute scale is assigned the number 273.16 K. What is the other fixed point on this (Kelvin) scale?\r\n(c) The absolute temperature (Kelvin scale) T is related to the temperature tc on the Celsius scale by tc = T \u2013 273.15. Why do we have 273.15 in this relation and not 273.16?\r\n(d) What is the temperature of the triple-point of water on an absolute scale whose unit interval size is equal to that of the Fahrenheit scale?",
        "Original Solution": "(i) Melting and boiling points of water aren\u2019t considered the standard fixed points because they vary with change in pressure, the temperature of the triple point of water is unique, and it does not vary with pressure.(ii) On Kelvin\u2019s scale, there is only a lower fixed point which is 273.16 K, the upper fixed point is not there.(iii) The relation is such because 273.15 K on Kelvin\u2019s scale corresponds to the melting point of ice while 273.16 K is the triple point of water.(iv) We know,\r\nRelation between the Fahrenheit scale and the Absolute scale,\r\ni.e.  \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\\\\\frac{T_{F}-32}{180}\\end{array} \\) = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{T_{K}-273}{100}\\end{array} \\) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we need to understand why modern thermometers use the triple point of water as a fixed point instead of the melting and boiling points of water, which were used in the original Celsius scale. The reason for this is that the melting and boiling points of water can vary depending on atmospheric pressure. The triple point of water, on the other hand, is a unique temperature at which water exists in all three states (solid, liquid, and gas) and does not change with variations in pressure.\n\nStep 2) In the question, it's mentioned that the Kelvin scale has a fixed point, the triple point of water, which is assigned the number 273.16 K. However, unlike the Celsius scale, the Kelvin scale only has a lower fixed point and not an upper fixed point.\n\nStep 3) The relation between the Celsius and Kelvin scale temperatures is given by the equation tc = T \u2013 273.15. The reason that 273.15 is used and not 273.16, despite the fact that 273.16 K is the triple point temperature of water, is because 273.15 K corresponds to the melting point of ice on the Kelvin scale.\n\nStep 4) Lastly, we address the question of the temperature of the triple point of water according to an absolute temperature scale whose unit interval size is the same as that of the Fahrenheit scale. To do this, we must consider the relationship between the Fahrenheit scale and the Absolute scale, given by the equation (T_{F}-32)/180 = (T_{K}-273)/100. If we further analyze this equation and apply some algebraic manipulation to solve for the temperature on a new hypothetical Fahrenheit-like scale where the unit interval matches that of the Kelvin scale, we find that the temperature of the triple point of water on this new scale is approximately 491.688 units.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We explain the use of the triple point of water as a fixed point in modern thermometers due to its unique nature and lack of variability with pressure changes. This stands in contrast to the melting and boiling points of water, which vary with pressure.\n\nStep 2) We clarify that the Kelvin scale only has a lower fixed point, unlike the Celsius scale which has both a lower and upper fixed point.\n\nStep 3) We explore the relationship between the Celsius and Kelvin scales, explaining why the relation uses 273.15 K (the melting point of ice) instead of the triple point temperature of water, 273.16 K.\n\nStep 4) We investigate the temperature of the triple point of water on an absolute temperature scale whose unit interval size is the same as that of the Fahrenheit scale. By analyzing the relationship between the Fahrenheit and Absolute scales, we deduce that the temperature of the triple point of water on this new, hypothetical scale would be approximately 491.688 units."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the problem, we are given that a steel tape of length 1m is correctly calibrated at a temperature of 27.0 C. It's important to remember that the length of objects can expand or shrink depending on the temperature, due to the property of thermal expansion. In this case, we are expressed the length in cm for ease of computation, so 1m becomes 100 cm.\n \nStep 2) The problem states that the length of a steel rod as measured by the tape on a hot day (temperature = 45.0 C) is 63.0 cm. But this measurement could be affected by the expansion of the tape due to the high temperature.\n \nStep 3) We know the coefficient of linear expansion (denoted by \u221d ) of steel is 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) K^(\u20131).

Its an inherent property of the material, in this case, steel.\n \nStep 4) We denote L as the actual length of the steel rod, and L\u2019 as the length at the high temperature (45 C). Knowing the magnitude of thermal expansion is given by \u221d * (\u0394T), where \u0394T is the change in temperature, we form the equation L\u2019 = L [1 + \u221d(T1 \u2013 T)], where T1 = 45 C and T = 27 C.\n \nStep 5) We plug in the known values into the equation: = 100 [1+ 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) (45- 27)], which simplifies to = 100[1+ 21.6 \u00d7 10^(\u20135)].

You are given: the initial length of the brass wire (l) as 1.8 meters; the initial temperature (T1) as 27 degrees Celsius; the final temperature (T2) as -39 degrees Celsius; the diameter of the wire (d) as 2.0 mm, which converts to 2\u00d710^(\u22123) meters; the coefficient of linear expansion of brass (\u03b1) as 2.0\u00d710^(\u22125) K^(\u22121); and Young\u2019s modulus of brass (Y), which is a measure of its rigidity, as 0.91\u00d710^11 Pascal(Pa). You are asked to find the tension developed in the wire, indicated by (F). Step 2) Understand the relationship between Young\u2019s modulus, stress and strain. The formula to calculate Young's modulus is Y = stress / strain. Since stress is also equal to force / area (F/A) and strain is change in length over original length (\u0394L/L), substitute the equations into the Young's modulus formula to get Y = (F x L) /(A x \u0394L). Rearranging the equation, you get \u0394L=F\u00d7L/(A\u00d7Y). In this equation, A is the cross-sectional area of the wire and can be calculated as A = (\u03c0d^2)/4 = (\u03c0(2\u00d710^\u22123)^2) / 4.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we identify the known variables. We know that both the brass and steel rod are the same length and diameter, 50 cm and 3 mm respectively. The initial temperature (T1) is 40\u00b0C and the final temperature (T2) is 250\u00b0C. We're given the co-efficient of linear expansion of brass as 2.0 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1) and for steel it's 1.2 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1). \n\nStep 2) Now, the increase in temperature, (\u2206T), is calculated by subtracting T1 from T2. \u2206T = T2 \u2013 T1, thus \u2206T = 250 \u2013 40, resulting in \u2206T =210\u00b0C.\n\nStep 3) We are looking for the change in lengths of both rods, so we must solve it separately for each rod. Starting with the brass rod, we use its co-efficient of linear expansion and apply it to the formula L1 = L0(1 + \u221d\u2206T). So L1 = 50(1 + 2 \u00d7 10^(-5)\u00d7210) = 50(1 + 420 \u00d7 10^(-5)) = 50\u00d7 1.00420 = 50.21 cm.\n\nStep 4) Now the increase in length of this brass rod is calculated by taking away the initial length from the final length. Increase in length of brass ( \u2206L) = L1 \u2013 L0, which results in \u2206L = 50.21 \u2013 50, giving us \u2206L = 0.21 cm.\n\nStep 5) We follow a similar procedure for the steel rod. We use its co-efficient of linear expansion in the formula L2= L0(1 + \u03b2\u2206T). Thus, L2 = 50(1 + 1.2 \u00d7 10^(-5)\u00d7210) = 50 \u00d7 1.00252 = 50.126 cm.\n\nStep 6) Similarly, we calculate the increase in length of this steel rod. Increase in length ( \u2206L\u2019) = L2 \u2013 L0, which gives us \u2206L\u2019 = 50.126 cm \u2013 50 cm = 0.126 cm.\n\nStep 7) Finally, we add the increases in lengths of both rods to get the total increase in length = \u2206L + \u2206L\u2019 = 0.21 + 0.126 = 0.336 cm.",

These are known values from the problem statement.\\n\nStep 2) Now let's understand the term 'fractional change in volume'. If the volume of the glycerine changes, possibly due to a change in temperature, the fractional change in volume is the change in volume divided by the original volume, represented by \u0394V/V. \u03b1V \u0394T represents the fractional volume change due to a change in temperature.\\n\nStep 3) Now that we know this, we can substitute our given values and we get an equation as follows: V_T2 - V_T1 = V_T1 \u03b1V \u0394T, where V_T2 is the final volume, V_T1 is the initial volume, \u03b1V is the coefficient of volume expansion, and \u0394T is the change in temperature. This equation simply states the initial volume adjusted by the volume change due to temperature rise equals the final volume.\\n\nStep 4) However, volume can also be presented as mass over density; let's substitute this into our equation: m/\u03c1_T2 - m/\u03c1_T1 = m/\u03c1_T1 \u03b1V \u0394T, where \u03c1_T2 is the final density, \u03c1_T1 is the initial density, and m is mass.

Therefore, P = 10^4 W.\nStep 2) The mass (m) of the aluminum block we are dealing with is given as 8 kg, but we need to convert this to grams because specific heat capacity is given in terms of grams. We use the fact that 1 kg is equal to 10^3 grams. Hence, m = 8 x 10^3g.\nStep 3) The time the machine operates is given as 2.5 minutes. We convert this to seconds because power is in Watts, which is Joules per second. Therefore, time, t = 2.5 x 60 = 150s.\nStep 4) We consider the total energy produced by the machine. This can be calculated using the formula for power, which is power (P) equals energy (E) divided by time(t). Rearranging for energy gives us the formula E = P x t. Hence, total energy = 10^4 x 150 = 15 x 10^5 J.\nStep 5) It's given that 50% of the total energy is either used up in heating the machine or lost to the surroundings. This means only half of the total energy is available for heating the block, represented by \u0394Q. So, \u0394Q = 1/2 x 15 x 10^5 = 7.5 x 10^5 J.\nStep 6) The increase in temperature (\u0394T) can be found from the relation \u0394Q = mc\u0394T, where c is the specific heat capacity of aluminum, m is the mass, and \u0394T is change in the temperature.

Thus, we can create the equality: m\u2019L = mc\u0394T. Step 3) We want to find m', the mass of the ice melted, so we should rearrange the equation to isolate m\u2019 on one side to get the equation: m\u2019 = mc\u0394T / L. Step 4) Now we just have to plug in the values we know. We substitute m with 2500 g (since 1 kg = 1000 g we get 2.5 x 1000), c with 0.39 J g^\u20131 K^\u20131, \u0394T with 500 (we must convert the Celsius to Kelvin because the specific heat capacity is given per degree Kelvin. But the temperature change is the same in both units because a 1 degree change in Celsius is the same as 1 degree change in Kelvin), and L with 335 to get m' = (2500 x 0.39 x 500) / 335 = 1500 g. Step 5) Convert the melted ice mass from grams to kilograms since the standard unit of mass in the SI system is kg. So we divide by 1000 to get m\u2019 = 1.5 kg.",

In an experiment on the specific heat of a metal, a 0.20 kg block of the metal at 150 C is dropped in a copper calorimeter (of water equivalent 0.025 kg) containing 150 cm^3 of water at 27 C. The final temperature is 40 C. Compute the specific heat of the metal.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides values for the mass of the metal block (m, 0.20 kg), initial temperature of the metal block (T1, 150\u00b0C), final temperature of the metal and the water that's heated (T2, 40\u00b0C), water equivalent of the calorimeter (m1, 0.025 kg), and the volume of water (V, 150 cm^3). All these values are converted into appropriate units for our equations. For example, the mass of the metal block is converted to grams for consistency with specific heat units, becoming 200 g. Step 2) The volume of water is used to compute its mass, M. Since water has a density of about 1 g/cm^3, the mass can be found by M=V x density = 150 x 1 = 150 g. Step 3) We now know the mass of the water heated, its initial temperature (27\u00b0C), and the final temperature (40\u00b0C). The change in temperature for the water and calorimeter system (\u0394T2) is calculated by subtracting the initial from the final temperature, \u0394T2=40-27=13\u00b0C. Step 4) Similarly, the change in the temperature for the metal block (\u0394T1) is found by subtracting the final temperature from the initial, \u0394T1=T1-T2=150-40=110\u00b0C. Step 5) The law of conservation of energy is applied in the form of the equation mH\u0394T1 = (M+m1)Cw\u0394T2, which states that the heat lost by the metal is equal to the heat gained by both the water and calorimeter. Here, H represents the specific heat of the metal (which we're trying to find), and Cw represents the specific heat of water (a known constant, 4.186 J/g\u00b0C). Step 6) This equation is then rearranged to solve for H, the specific heat of the metal. H = [(M+m1)Cw\u0394T2]/m\u0394T1 is the resultant equation. Step 7) Known values are inserted into this equation now. H = [(150 +25) x 4.186 x 13]/(200 x 110) = 0.43 J/g\u00b0C, which is the specific heat of the metal. Step 8) Lastly, the effect of heat loss to the environment is considered. Since any heat lost to the environment reduces the observed change in the water's temperature, and thus reduces the computed value for the metal's specific heat, we can conclude that the answer would be smaller than the actual specific heat of the metal if heat losses are relevant.",

If the fever is brought down to 98 F in 20 minutes, what is the average rate of extra evaporation caused by the drug? Assume the evaporation mechanism to be the only way by which heat is lost. The mass of the child is 30 kg. The specific heat of the human body is approximately the same as that of water, and the latent heat of evaporation of water at that temperature is about 580 cal g^\u20131.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's list down the values we know from the question: The initial temperature of the child (Ti) is 101 F and the final temperature after medicine was given to the child (Tf) is 98 F. The decrease in temperature (\u0394T) is (101\u221298)\u00b0F. Since we normally work with Celsius (C) in heat calculations, let's convert this to Celsius using the conversion formula (F-32)*(5/9) which equals 1.670 C. The mass of the child (m) is provided as 30 kg which we convert into grams (g) by multiplying by 1000 because heat calculations typically use grams for mass, so m=30*10^3 g. The time it took to reduce the temperature (t) is given as 20 minutes. The specific heat capacity (c) for the human body, approximated as water's specific heat, is c =1000 cal kg^-1 C^-1. The latent heat of evaporation for water (L), which the body uses to dissipate heat via sweat evaporation, is given as L=580 cal g^\u22121. Step 2) By the principle of heat transfer, the heat lost by the child's body due to the fever and drug induced sweat evaporation can be computed by the formula \u0394\u03b8 = mc\u0394T, where \u0394\u03b8 is the total heat lost. Substituting the known values, we get \u0394\u03b8 = 30*1000*1.67 = 50100 cal. This is the total amount of heat that has been lost by the child. Step 3) Next, we want to understand how much water (in weight) has been evaporated from the child\u2019s body due to this process. We denote the mass of evaporated water by m\u2019. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total heat lost by the body (\u0394\u03b8) should be equal to the latent heat gained by water evaporation, or m\u2019 = \u0394\u03b8/L. So this gives us m\u2019 = (50100/580) = 86.37 g. Step 4) To find the rate of evaporation, we divide the total weight of the evaporated water (m\u2019) by the time it took to achieve that (t). This gives us the average rate of evaporation = 86.2/20 = 4.3 g/min.",

Step 2) Calculate the total heat lost from the child's body by using the heat transfer formula \u0394\u03b8 = mc\u0394T, where m is the mass of the child, c is the specific heat capacity, and \u0394T is the change in temperature. Substitute all known values into this formula to get the total heat lost. Step 3) Now find the mass of water evaporated from the body using energy conservation principle stating that the total heat lost should be equal to the latent heat gained due to water evaporation. Use the formula m\u2019 = \u0394\u03b8/L, where m\u2019 is the mass of water evaporated, \u0394\u03b8 is the total heat lost, and L is the latent heat of water.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first thing we do is to convert all the given measures to the standard SI units. For facilitating the calculation, the side of the cubical icebox and the thickness of the icebox were converted from centimeters to meters. Given that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, we turn 30 cm into 0.30 m and 5 cm into 0.05m. Time was converted from hours to seconds, with 1 hour equal to 60 minutes and 1 minute has 60 seconds, therefore multiplying 6 hours by 60 we get the minutes and then again multiplied by 60 to get the final time in seconds which turns out to be 21600 seconds.\nStep 2) We then calculate the temperature difference. Knowing that the temperature inside the icebox remains at the freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius, and the given outside temperature is 45 degrees Celsius, the temperature difference is simply 45\u00b0C - 0\u00b0C = 45\u00b0C.\nStep 3) To find the amount of heat entering the icebox, we'll first determine the surface area of the icebox. A cube has 6 equal sides so the total surface area is 6 times the area of each side, which is 0.30^2.  This gives a total surface area of 0.54 m^2.\nStep 4) We now have all the values needed to substitute into the formula for heat conduction which is Q = KA(T1\u2212T2)t/L. Q is the total heat entering the icebox, K is the thermal conductivity, A is the surface area, (T1\u2212T2) is the temperature difference, t is the time, and L is the thickness of the material.\nStep 5) Substituting the known values into this formula, we obtain Q = 1.05 x 10^5 Joules.\nStep 6) In calculating how much ice melts, we'll use the formula Q= mL where m is the mass of the ice that melts and L is the latent heat of fusion. Rearranging this equation to m = Q/L and plugging in our values, we find that m is equal to 0.313 kg. This represents the amount of ice that melts over the 6 hour period.\nStep 7) The final step is to find the amount of remaining ice. We subtract the amount of ice that melts (0.313 kg) from the initial quantity of ice (4 kg), which gives us 3.687 kg of ice remains after 6 hours.",

The thickness of the boiler (d) is 1.0 cm, but note that we need to convert this to meters to align with the SI units, giving us 0.01 m. The brass boiler is said to boil water at a rate (R) of 6.0 kg/min. From this, deduce that the mass (m) boiled in one minute is 6 kg. The thermal conductivity of brass (K) is confirmed to be 109 Js^(\u22121)m^(\u22121)K^(\u22121) and the heat of vaporisation of water (L) is given as 2256 \u00d7 10^3 Jkg^(\u22121).

This formula suggests that the amount of heat (Q) entering the water through the base of the boiler is contributed by thermal conductivity, area, temperature difference, time, and thickness of the boiler. Plugging the known values, we have equation (1) as Q = [109 x 0.15 x (T1 \u2013 100) x 60]/ 0.01.\nStep 4) Consider the heat absorbed by the water to change phases using the equation Q=mL.

        "Original Solution": "(a) A body with a large reflectivity is a poor absorber of heat radiation. A poor absorber will be a poor emitter of radiation. Therefore, a body with a large reflectivity is a poor emitter.\r\n(b) Brass is a good conductor of heat, and wood is a poor conductor of heat. When we touch a brass tumbler, heat is conducted from our hand to the tumbler, and there is a drop in the body temperature; therefore, we feel cold.  When a wooden tray is touched on a chilly day, very less heat is conducted from the hand to the wooden tray, and body temperature is not decreased much. So we do not feel cold.\r\n(c) The radiation energy from a red-hot iron piece placed in a furnace is given by the relation\r\nE=\u03c3T4\r\nWhen the iron piece is placed in the open, the radiation energy is given by the relation\r\nE=\u03c3(T4\u2212T04)\r\nHere, E is the energy radiation.\r\nT is the temperature of the optical pyrometer.\r\n\u03c3 is a constant.\r\nT0 is the temperature of the open space.\r\nThe increase in the temperature of the open space reduces the radiation energy.\r\n(d)  If there is no atmosphere, extra heat will not be trapped. All the heat from the sun will be radiated back from the surface of the earth. So without the atmosphere, the earth would be inhospitably cold.\r\n(e) Steam at 100 0C is much hotter than water at 100 0C. This is because steam will have a lot of heat in the form of latent heat (540 cal/g).  Therefore, heating systems based on the circulation of steam are more efficient in warming a building than those based on the circulation of hot water.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Consider the body with large reflectivity. Recall that reflectivity refers to the amount of light or heat that a surface can reflect back. This would mean that such a body absorbs less heat or light since most of it is reflected back. Now, according to Kirchhoff's law, the absorption coefficient and emission coefficient are equal. Hence, if a body is a poor absorber of heat, it will also be a poor emitter of heat. Thus, a body with a large reflectivity is a poor emitter. Step 2) Discuss the difference between touching a brass tumbler and a wooden tray on a chilly day. Brass is a good conductor of heat, meaning it allows heat to pass through it easily. When you touch the brass tumbler, heat from your hand is quickly conducted to the brass, making your hand feel colder as heat leaves your body. Conversely, wood is a poor conductor of heat, so less heat is transferred from your hand to the wooden tray. Your hand maintains its body temperature better and doesn't feel as cold as when touching the brass. Step 3) Understand the operation of an optical pyrometer. This device is used to measure the temperature of a body by detecting the intensity of the radiation it emits. When the pyrometer is calibrated for ideal black body radiation, it assumes no heat is being absorbed by the surrounding atmosphere. However, if we measure the temperature of a red-hot iron piece placed in the open, the open atmosphere will absorb some of the radiation, thereby decreasing the observed intensity of the radiation. This results in a lower measured temperature than the actual temperature of the iron piece. On the other hand, when the same iron piece is in a furnace, the influence of the surrounding atmosphere is negligible and the pyrometer gives a correct reading. This is explained through the equations E=\u03c3T4 for the furnace condition and E=\u03c3(T4\u2212T04) for the open condition, where E is energy radiation, T is the temperature measured by the pyrometer, \u03c3 is a constant, and T0 is the temperature of the open space. Step 4) Contemplate the earth without its atmosphere. Remember that the earth's atmosphere traps heat, preventing some of it from radiating back out into space and thereby warming the earth. If the earth did not have an atmosphere, it would not trap this heat, and all heat from the sun would be radiated back from the surface of the earth, leaving the earth exceedingly cold. Step 5) Compare heating systems based on hot water circulation and steam circulation. Steam is at a higher energy state than water at the same temperature due to its high latent heat (540 cal/g). This makes steam-based heating systems more efficient in warming a building than those based on circulating hot water.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the correlation between reflectivity, absorptivity, and emissivity of a body. A body with large reflectivity reflects more and absorbs less. If a body is a poor absorber, it will also be a poor emitter according to Kirchhoff's law. Step 2) Differentiate between good and poor conductors of heat. Brass, a good conductor, absorbs heat from your hand quickly making your hand feel colder. Wood, being a poor conductor, absorbs less heat from your hand, resulting in less decrease in hand temperature. Step 3) Discuss the functioning of an optical pyrometer in different conditions. In an open atmosphere, some heat is absorbed by the surroundings, leading to a lower reading on the pyrometer, whereas, in a furnace, negligible heat is absorbed by the surroundings, and the pyrometer reading is accurate. The difference is explained by the equations E=\u03c3T4 and E=\u03c3(T4\u2212T04). Step 4) Recognize the role of the earth's atmosphere in maintaining the planet's temperature. Without an atmosphere, the earth would not trap heat, all sun's heat would be radiated back, resulting in a frigid earth. Step 5) Recognize the higher energy state of steam compared to water at the same temperature. Steam contains more heat in the form of latent heat, thus steam-based heating systems are more efficient than water-based heating systems for warming buildings."

These are the initial temperature of the body, T1=80 C, and the final temperature of the body, T2=50 C. The time it takes to cool these temperatures, t, equals 5 minutes. Also, the temperature of the surroundings, T0, is 20 C. Step 2) Next, calculate the average temperature. This is done by adding the initial and final temperatures together and dividing by 2: (T1 + T2) /2 = (80 + 50)/2 = 65 C. Step 3) Calculate the temperature difference, \u0394T, by subtracting the surrounding temperature from the average temperature: \u0394T= 65 C  \u2013 20 C = 45 C. Step 4) Use Newton\u2019s law of cooling to find the rate of cooling, K. According to Newton\u2019s law of cooling, the rate of cooling is directly proportional to the difference in temperature. This can be formulated as: Change in temperature/ Time = K \u0394T. By substituting the given values into this equation, we can solve for K: (T2 \u2013 T1)/t = K\u0394T yields (80 \u2013 50)/5 =K(45). Solve for K: K = (80 \u2013 50)/5 / 45 = K = 2/15.

Start by identifying the new initial temperature of the body, T1=60 C, and the new final temperature of the body, T2=30 C. Step 6) Next, calculate the new average temperature to be (T1 + T2)/2 = (60 + 30)/2 = 45 C. By subtracting the surrounding temperature you should get the new temperature difference, \u0394T= 45 C \u2013 20 C = 25 C. Step 7) Utilize Newton\u2019s law of cooling again, but this time solve for t since we now know K. Substitute the identified and calculated values into the equation to begin solving for t: (T2 \u2013 T1)/t = K\u0394T yields (60 \u2013 30)/t = (2/15) (25).

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understanding the P-T phase diagram of CO2 requires recognizing the different regions of the graph which correspond to different phases of CO2: solid, liquid, and gas, as well as the lines that represent phase changes. It also includes points such as the triple point, where all three phases can exist in equilibrium, and the critical point, beyond which gas and liquid phases become indistinguishable. Step 2) The triple point of CO2, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist, is identified on the phase diagram at a specific temperature and pressure. In this case, the triple point occurs at -56.6\u00b0C and 5.11 atm. Step 3) The phase diagram also indicates that the fusion (melting) and boiling points of CO2 decrease as pressure decreases. This is because reducing the pressure reduces the kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to changes in phase at lower temperatures. Step 4) The critical temperature and pressure can be found, which is the point beyond which the liquid and gas phases of a substance become indistinguishable. For CO2, these are 31.1\u00b0C and 73 atm respectively. Above this temperature, and regardless of pressure, CO2 behaves as a gas due to the kinetic energy of its molecules being too high for them to be forced into a liquid state. Step 5) Finally, we can use this understanding of the phase diagram to determine the phase of CO2 at different temperatures and pressures. At -70\u00b0C and 1 atm, CO2 is a gas (below the line of sublimation). At -60\u00b0C and 10 atm, CO2 is solid (located in the solid area of the diagram).

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We first have to identify the key parameters, which are the initial temperature (90 C), the final temperature (10 C), the cooling time (5 minutes), and the surrounding temperature (20 C). Step 2) Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the object and the surrounding. Thus, we will consider the average temperature of the initial and final temperatures, which is (90C + 10C) / 2 = 50C. Step 3) The difference in temperature between the object and the surrounding is 50C - 20C = 30C. And the time it took to reach from 90C to 10C was 5 minutes. So we can write Newton's law of cooling as Change in temperature / Time = k*\u0394t, where k is a proportionality constant and \u0394t is the temperature difference. This gives us 30C / 5 min = k*30C, or k = 30C / 5 min / 30C. Step 4) Similarly, for the cooling from 60C to 30C, we first calculate the average temperature (60C + 30C) / 2 = 45C. The difference in temperature from the surrounding becomes 45C - 20C = 25C. For this case, we still don't know the time, so we denote it with t. We set up the same equation as before: Change in temperature / Time = k*\u0394t, or 30C / t = k*25C. Step 5) Now, we can compare these two conditions by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2, which gives us 30C/5 min / 30C/t = 30C/25C. Cancelling out the similar terms, we can find the value of the unknown t, which comes out to be 6 minutes. Hence, it takes 6 minutes for the object to cool from 60C to 30C.",

Divide this difference by the time to define the proportionality constant k. Step 4) Apply the law of cooling similarly to the temperature drop from 60C to 30C and set up an equation like the previous one, but this time with the unknown time t.

        "Original Solution": "Given\r\nWater is flowing at a rate of 3.0 litre/min\r\nThe geyser heats the water, raising the temperature from 270 C to 770 C.\r\nInitial temperature, T1 = 270 C\r\nFinal temperature, T2 = 770 C\r\nRise in temperature, T = T2 \u2013 T1\r\n= 77 \u2013 27\r\n= 500 C\r\nHeat of combustion = 4 x 10^4 J / g\r\nSpecific heat of water, C = 4.2 J / g C\r\nMass of flowing water, m = 3.0 litre / min\r\n= 3000 g / min\r\nTotal heat used, Q = mcT\r\n= 3000 x 4.2 x 50\r\nOn calculation, we get,\r\n= 6.3 x 10^5 J / min\r\nRate of consumption = 6.3 x 10^5 / (4 x 10^4)\r\nWe get,\r\n= 15.75 g/min\r\nTherefore, rate of consumption is 15.75 g/min",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we identify all the known quantities in the problem: water is flowing at 3 litres per minute, the geyser is heating the water from an initial temperature, T1, of 27 degrees Celsius to a final temperature, T2, of 77 degrees Celsius, and the heat of combustion provided by the fuel is 4 x 10^4 joules per gram. \n\n Step 2) We then calculate the change in temperature, T. To do this, we subtract T1 from T2, which gives us T = 77 - 27 = 50 degrees Celsius. It gives the amount of temperature rise due to the operation of the geyser. \n\n Step 3) We also note that the specific heat of water, C, which is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius, is going to be 4.2 joules per gram degree Celsius. This is a constant and well-known value in Physics. \n\n Step 4) Furthermore, we recognize that the flow rate of water given is in litres per minute; however, to be usable in our equation, we need it in grams. We do this conversion knowing that 1 litre of water is equivalent to 1000 grams. Hence, the flow rate of water is 3000 grams per minute.\n\n Step 5) Afterwards, we use the formula for total heat used, represented by the symbol Q, which is mcT, where m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat of water, and T is the rise in temperature. Plugging our values into the equation, we get Q = 3000 x 4.2 x 50 = 6.3 x 10^5 joules per minute.\n\n Step 6) Finally, we calculate the rate of consumption of the fuel. To do this, we divide the total heat used by the heat of combustion of the fuel. That is 6.3 x 10^5 / (4 x 10^4) = 15.75 grams per minute.

The given mass in g's helps us to easily use it later to calculate the number of moles. Step 2) The next step is to calculate the number of moles (n) from the known values of mass and molecular mass. We use the formula n = mass / molecular mass (w/m) which is n = 20 g / 28 g/mol, which simplifies to n = 0.714 moles (with rounding to three decimal places). Step 3) We are told that nitrogen is a diatomic molecule so the heat capacity at constant pressure (C), is given by C = 7R / 2, where R = 8.3 J mol^-1 K^-1.

        "Question": "3. Explain why \r\n(a) Two bodies at different temperatures T1 and T2 if brought in thermal contact, do not necessarily settle to the mean temperature (T1 + T2)/2. \r\n(b) The coolant in a chemical or a nuclear plant (i.e., the liquid used to prevent the different parts of a plant from getting too hot) should have high specific heat. \r\n(c) Air pressure in a car tyre increases during driving. \r\n(d) The climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude.",
        "Original Solution": "(i). When two bodies having different temperatures, say T1 and T2 are brought in thermal contact with each other, there is a flow of heat from the body at the higher temperature to the body at the lower temperature till both the bodies reach an equilibrium position, i.e., both the bodies are having equal temperature. The equilibrium temperature is only equal to the mean temperature when the thermal capacities of both the bodies are equal.\r\n(ii).The coolant used in a chemical or nuclear plant should always have a high specific heat. Higher is the specific heat of the coolant, higher is its capacity to absorb heat and release heat. Therefore, a liquid with a high specific heat value is the best coolant to be used in a nuclear or chemical plant. This would prevent different parts of the plant from getting too hot.\r\n(iii). When the driver is driving a vehicle then due to the motion of air molecules the air temperature inside the tyre increases. And according to the Charles\u2019 law, the temperature is directly proportional to pressure.\r\nTherefore, when the temperature inside a tyre increases, then there is also an increase of air pressure.\r\n(iv). The relative humidity in a harbour town is more than that of the relative humidity in a desert town. Humidity is a measure of water vapor in the atmosphere and the specific heat of water vapor is very high. Therefore, the climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) For part (a), we start by understanding the basic principle that heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature until equilibrium is reached, which is when both bodies have the same temperature. This is a fundamental law of thermodynamics.\nStep 2) The equilibrium temperature, however, may not be equal to the mean temperature (T1 + T2)/2. The reason is that the thermal capacities of both bodies must be considered as well. If the two bodies have identical thermal capacities, then the equilibrium temperature will indeed be the mean temperature. But if they differ, the equilibrium temperature will shift towards the temperature of the body with larger thermal capacity. This is because the body with a larger thermal capacity can absorb or release more heat before its temperature changes significantly.\nStep 3) For part (b), the choice of coolant in chemical or nuclear plants is crucial. A coolant with a high specific heat is preferred. The specific heat of a substance reflects its ability to absorb heat. So, a coolant with a higher specific heat can absorb more heat without its temperature rising excessively, thus effectively controlling the temperature of various parts of the plant.\nStep 4) For part (c), we can refer to Charles' law which states that the volume of a gas increases with its temperature if the pressure and the amount of gas remain constant. However, in a car tyre, the volume is fixed. Consequently, if the temperature rises (due to the motion of air molecules brought about by driving), the pressure has to increase to maintain the constant volume. Hence, the air pressure in a car tyre increases during driving.\nStep 5) In part (d), we discuss why a harbour town has a more temperate climate compared to a desert town at the same latitude. A key factor lies in their relative humidity - the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Harbour towns generally have a high relative humidity due to their proximity to large bodies of water. Water has a high specific heat, meaning it can absorb or release a large amount of heat before its temperature changes significantly. Therefore, the large amount of water vapor in the air helps to moderate temperature fluctuations, resulting in a more temperate climate.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) For Part (a), we analyze the flow of heat between two bodies with different temperatures until they reach equilibrium. We note that the equilibrium temperature is not necessarily the mean temperature of the two bodies, unless their thermal capacities are equal.\nStep 2) For Part (b), we understand the role of the coolant in a chemical or a nuclear plant. We highlight the importance of having a coolant with high specific heat, so it can absorb large amounts of heat and prevent the plant from overheating.\nStep 3) For Part (c), we discuss the connection between the rising air temperature in a car tyre during driving and the subsequent increase in air pressure, referencing Charles' law.\nStep 4) For Part (d), we examine the reason a harbour town has a more temperate climate than a desert town at the same latitude, focusing on the role of relative humidity and the specific heat of water in modulating temperature fluctuations."

        "Original Solution": "The cylinder is completely insulated from its surroundings.\r\nTherefore, no heat is exchanged between the system (cylinder) and its surroundings.\r\nThus, the process is adiabatic\r\nInitial pressure inside the cylinder = P1\r\nFinal pressure inside the cylinder = P2\r\nInitial volume inside the cylinder = V1\r\nFinal volume inside the cylinder = V2\r\nRatio of specific heat, \u03b3 = Cp / Cv = 1.4\r\nFor an adiabatic process, we have:\r\nP1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3\r\nThe final volume is compressed to half of its initial volume\r\nHence,\r\nV2 = V1 / 2\r\nP1V1\u03b3 = P2(V1 / 2)\u03b3\r\nP2 / P1 = V1\u03b3 / (V1 / 2)\u03b3\r\n= 21.4\r\nWe get,\r\n= 2.639\r\nTherefore, the pressure increases by a factor of 2.639",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Observe the situation. We are given a cylinder completely insulated from its surroundings and containing hydrogen gas. The insulation indicates that no heat is exchanged between the system aka the cylinder, and the environment. This characterizes an adiabatic process. Step 2) List all the important parameters. At the start of the process, our initial pressure inside the cylinder = P1 and the initial volume = V1. As a result of compression, the final pressure = P2 and the final volume = V2. We also need the ratio of specific heat, \u03b3, which is Cp / Cv, and equals 1.4 for hydrogen. Step 3) Recall the suitable formula for an adiabatic process, which is P1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3. This equation relates the initial and final pressure and volume of an adiabatic process. Step 4) Here, we are compressing the gas to half its original volume, therefore, V2 = V1 / 2. Step 5) Next, insert this value into the above equation. Hence, we get P1V1\u03b3 = P2(V1 / 2)\u03b3.

Carry out the division and the exponentiation to get P2 / P1 = 21.4, or equivalently, P2 / P1 = 2.639 to three decimal places. Step 7) Interpret the result.

Step 2) Identify all the essential parameters: initial pressure (P1), final pressure (P2), initial volume (V1), final volume (V2), and the ratio of specific heat, \u03b3. Step 3) Use the adiabatic process formula, which relates initial and final pressures and volumes: P1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3.

        "Question": "5. In changing the state of a gas adiabatically from an equilibrium state A to another equilibrium state B, an amount of work equal to 22.3 J is done on the system. If the gas is taken from state A to B via a process in which the net heat absorbed by the system is 9.35 cal, how much is the net work done by the system in the latter case? (Take 1 cal = 4.19 J)",
        "Original Solution": "Given\r\nThe work done (W) on the system while the gas changes from state A to state B is 22.3 J\r\nThis is an adiabatic process.\r\nTherefore, change in heat is zero.\r\nSo,\r\n\u0394Q = 0\r\n\u0394W = \u2013 22.3 (Since the work is done on the system)\r\nFrom first law of thermodynamics, we have:\r\n\u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W\r\nWhere,\r\n\u0394U = Change in the internal energy of the gas\r\nHence,\r\n\u0394U = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394W\r\n= 0 \u2013 (-22.3 J)\r\nWe get,\r\n\u0394U = + 22.3 J\r\nWhen the gas goes from state A to state B via a process, the net heat absorbed by the system is:\r\n\u0394Q = 9.35 cal\r\n= 9.35 x 4.19\r\nOn calculation, we get,\r\n= 39.1765 J\r\nHeat absorbed, \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W\r\nThus,\r\n\u0394W = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394U\r\n= 39.1765 \u2013 22.3\r\nWe get,\r\n= 16.8765 J\r\nHence, 16.88 J of work is done by the system",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the given information from the problem, which tells us that work (W) equal to 22.3 J was done on the system during an adiabatic process as the gas transitions from state A to B. In an adiabatic process, the change in heat (\u0394Q) is zero because there's no heat exchange with the surroundings. Hence, \u0394Q = 0. Step 2) Since work is being done on the system, it's conventionally taken as negative. Therefore, \u0394W = -22.3 J. Step 3) Apply the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy of a system (\u0394U) is equal to the sum of the heat change (\u0394Q) and work done on or by the system (\u0394W). This equation is \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W. Step 4) Rearrange the equation to solve for \u0394U, yielding the equation \u0394U = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394W. Plug the known values into the equation to find \u0394U, which is 0 - (-22.3 J). As a result, \u0394U = 22.3 J; that is, the change in internal energy of the gas is 22.3 J. Step 5) Evaluate a different process in which the gas moves from state A to B, but this time the net heat absorbed by the system is \u0394Q = 9.35 cal. Convert this amount to joules using the conversion factor 1 cal = 4.19 J. So, \u0394Q = 9.35 * 4.19 J = 39.1765 J. Step 6) Use the first law of thermodynamics again, in this alternative process. Using \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W, we can rearrange it once more for the new \u0394W by \u0394W = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394U. Substitute the known values into this equation to obtain \u0394W = 39.1765 J - 22.3 J = 16.8765 J. Hence, in the second case, the work done by the system is 16.88 J.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Find the given values and understand the nature of the process. An adiabatic process means no heat is exchanged, hence \u0394Q = 0 and work done on the system, \u0394W, is -22.3 J.

By substituting the known values, we find that \u0394U = 22.3 J. Step 3) Consider a different process where the gas is taken from state A to B absorbing an amount of heat, \u0394Q = 9.35 cal. Convert this to joules, resulting in \u0394Q = 39.1765 J. Step 4) With the first law of thermodynamics again, rearrange to find the new work done by the system, \u0394W = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394U.

        "Question": "6. Two cylinders A and B of equal capacity are connected to each other via a stopcock. A contains a gas at standard temperature and pressure. B is completely evacuated. The entire system is thermally insulated. The stopcock is suddenly opened. Answer the following: \r\n(a) What is the final pressure of the gas in A and B? \r\n(b) What is the change in internal energy of the gas? \r\n(c) What is the change in the temperature of the gas? \r\n(d) Do the intermediate states of the system (before settling to the final equilibrium state) lie on its P-V-T surface?",
        "Original Solution": "(a). Now, as soon as the stop cock is opened the gas will start flowing from cylinder P to cylinder Q which is completely evacuated, and thus the volume of the gas will be doubled because both the cylinders have equal capacity.  And since the pressure is inversely proportional to volume, hence the pressure will get decreased to half of the original value.\r\nSince the initial pressure of the gas in cylinder P is 1 atm, therefore, the pressure in each of the cylinder will now be 0.5 atm.\r\n(b). Here, in this case, the internal energy of the gas will not change i.e. \u0394U = 0. It is because the internal energy can change only when the work is done by the system or on the system. Since in this case, no work is done by the gas or on the gas.\r\nTherefore, the internal energy of the gas will not change.\r\n(c) There will be no change in the temperature of the gas. It is because during the expansion of gas there is no work being done by the gas.\r\nTherefore, there will be no change in the temperature of the gas in this process.\r\n(d). The above case is the clear case of free expansion and free expansion is rapid and it cannot be controlled. The intermediate states do not satisfy the gas equation and since they are in non \u2013 equilibrium states, they do not lie on the Pressure-Volume \u2013 Temperature surface of the system",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Recognize the problem parameters. We have two cylinders A and B which have the same capacity. Cylinder A contains a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), and cylinder B is empty.\\n Step 2) When the stopcock is opened, the gas from A will immediately start moving to B. This is because cylinder B is a vacuum, and gases tend to move from areas of high pressure (cylinder A) to low pressure (the vacuum in cylinder B).\\n Step 3) Since both cylinders have the same capacity, the volume of the gas will double when it expands to fill both cylinders. This is based on the characteristics of gases, which tend to occupy all available space.\\n Step 4) Using the principle of gas laws, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume, given that temperature remains constant. When the volume doubles, the pressure will decrease to half its initial value. Hence, the final pressure of the gas in both cylinders will be half the original pressure, which is 0.5 atm.\\n Step 5) The change in internal energy is zero. The internal energy of a gas can change when work is done by the system or on the system. In this case, the gas is not performing any work to move\u2014it is simply expanding due to the pressure difference. Therefore, there is no change in internal energy (\u0394U = 0).\\n Step 6) The temperature of the gas will not change. In an ideal gas, temperature change would accompany any work done by the gas. However, in this case, the gas does not do any work during expansion; hence, there is no change in temperature.\\n Step 7) The intermediate states do not lie on the Pressure\u2013Volume\u2013Temperature (PVT) surface of the system. The process of gas moving from cylinder A to cylinder B is a rapid and uncontrolled free expansion, which leads to non-equilibrium intermediate states. These states do not satisfy the ideal gas law, hence they do not lie on the PVT surface.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the scenario: Two equal capacity cylinders are connected; one cylinder contains gas, the other is a vacuum.\\n Step 2) On opening the stopcock, the gas flows to the vacant cylinder, thus doubling its volume.\\n Step 3) Apply the basic principle of gas laws: Pressure is inversely proportional to volume, thus the pressure halves.\\n Step 4) No physical work is done by the gas or on the gas, hence internal energy remains unchanged (\u0394U = 0).\\n Step 5) The temperature of the gas also remains unchanged as there's no work done during the expansion.\\n Step 6) The intermediate states during expansion do not lie on the Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) surface as they do not satisfy the gas laws due to the rapid, uncontrolled expansion process."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start with listing the known values. The volume of the cylinder (V1) is given as 30 litres, which is equal to 30 x 10^-3 m^3. The initial gauge pressure (P1) is 15 atm, which translates to 15 x 1.013 x 10^5 Pa. The temperature initially is 27 C, corresponding to 300 K in Kelvin scale. The molecular mass of O2 is also given as 32 g or 32 u.\n\nStep 2) We use the ideal gas law equation P1V1 = n1RT1, where n1 is the initial number of moles of oxygen in the cylinder and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)). By rearranging the equation to solve for n1, we get n1 = P1V1 / RT1.

Thus, m1 = n1* M = 18.276 x 32 = 584.84 g. \n\nStep 4) After some oxygen is withdrawn, we now have a new set of properties. The final gauge pressure (P2) is 11 atm, equal to 11 x 1.013 x 10^5 Pa. The final temperature (T2) is 17 C, which equals 290 K. \n\nStep 5) Apply the ideal gas law for these new properties. P2V2 = n2RT2, where n2 is the final number of moles of oxygen in the cylinder. Solving for n2, we get n2 = P2V2 / RT2 = (11.143 x 10^5 x 30 x 10^-3) / (8.314 x 290) equals 13.86.\n\nStep 6) The final mass of the oxygen, m2, is found by multiplying n2 by the molecular mass of oxygen, yielding m2 = n2 * M = 13.86 x 32 = 453.1 g.\n\nStep 7) Lastly, we can calculate the mass of oxygen taken out of the cylinder, by subtracting the final mass of oxygen in the cylinder from the initial mass. That is, mass withdrawn = m1 - m2 = 584.84 g - 453.1 g = 131.74 g, or 0.131 kg. Thus, 0.131 kg of oxygen is taken out of the cylinder.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, we should recognize what's given in the problem. The initial volume of the air bubble, V1, is given as 1.0 cm^3. As we will deal with SI units in our equations, it's necessary to convert this to m^3 which gives us 1.0 x 10^-6 m^3. The air bubble rises from a depth, d, of 40 m in the lake. The initial temperature at this depth, T1, is 12 C. Converting this temperature to Kelvin, which is the SI unit for temperature, gives us 285 K. The surface temperature, T2, is given as 35 C, and converting to Kelvin gives us 308 K. Step 2) The pressure on the surface of the lake, P2, is given as 1 atm, and we convert this to the SI unit of pressure, Pascal, to get 1.013 x 10^5 Pa. To find the pressure 40 m underwater where the bubble forms, P1, we need to account for the pressure caused by the weight of the water above. This is calculated using the formula P1= 1 atm + d\u03c1g, where \u03c1 is the density of water (10^3 kg / m^3) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2). After calculating, we get P1 as 493300 Pa. Step 3) We use the ideal gas law equation P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2, where V2 is, what we want to find - the volume of the air bubble when it reaches the surface. Rearranging the equation to solve for V2, we get V2 = P1V1T2 / T1P2. Plugging all known values into this equation yields V2 as 5.263 x 10^(-6) m^3, or, converting back to cm^3 for ease of understanding, 5.263 cm^3. This is the volume of the air bubble when it reaches the surface.",

The depth from which the bubble rises (d) is 40 m. The initial temperature (T1) is 12 C, convert to K. The temperature at the lake surface (T2) is 35 C, convert to K. Step 2) Identify and calculate the pressures. The surface pressure (P2) is 1 atm, convert to Pa. The pressure at 40 m depth (P1) is calculated using the formula P1= 1 atm + d\u03c1g, substituting the values for density of water (\u03c1) and acceleration due to gravity (g), results in P1 as 493300 Pa.

In these conditions, the temperatures are stated as room temperature (specifically 27 C), surface temperature of the Sun (given as 6000 K), and within the core of a star (a staggering 10 million or 10^7 K). Step 2) We use the formula for the average thermal energy per atom, given by (3/2)kT, where k denotes the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 m^2 kg s^-2 K^-1) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Step 3) For room temperature, we first need to convert it from Celsius to Kelvin. Recall that to translate from Celsius to Kelvin, we need to add 273 to the Celsius temperature. Therefore, 27 C = 27 + 273 = 300 K.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we know that the three vessels are of the same capacity, meaning they have the same volume. Also, the gases they contain exist at the same temperature and pressure. This tells us that all three conditions are all equally met for all three gases. Step 2) According to Avogadro\u2019s law, equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, will contain an equal number of molecules. So, yes, the three vessels will contain an equal number of the respective molecules. This number is equal to Avogadro's number, which is N = 6.023 x 10^23.

Note that k (Boltzmann constant) and T (Temperature) are constants with equal values for all gases. Step 4) Understand that Vrms \u221d (1/m)1/2, thus root mean square speeds differ between gases because their atomic masses differ.

This includes the temperature of the helium atom (THe), which is -20 degrees Celsius or 253 Kelvin (K), the atomic mass of argon (MAr), which is 39.9 atomic units (u), and the atomic mass of helium (MHe), which is 4.0 u. Additionally, we set a variable (Vrms)Ar to denote the root mean square (rms) speed of argon and (Vrms)He to denote the rms speed of helium. All together, we have: THe = -20 degrees C = 253 K, MAr = 39.9 u, MHe = 4.0 u, (Vrms)Ar, and (Vrms)He.

After simplifying, we find that the ratio of the temperature of argon to the atomic mass of argon is equal to the ratio of the temperature of helium to the atomic mass of helium (or, TAr / MAr = THe / MHe).

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by defining all known values from the problem. The pressure inside the cylinder containing nitrogen, P, is given as 2.0 atm which must be converted to the SI unit of Pascal (Pa), using 1 atm = 1.013 x 10^5 Pa. Hence, P = 2.0 x 1.013 x 10^5 = 2.026 x 10^5 Pa. The temperature inside the cylinder, T, is given as 170 C which must also be converted to the SI unit of Kelvin (K), using the relation T(K) = T(C) + 273.15. Therefore, T = 170 + 273.15 = 290 K. The radius of a nitrogen molecule, r, is given as 1.0 \u00c5, which needs to be converted into the SI unit of a meter (m) using the relation 1 \u00c5 = 10^(-10) m. So, r = 1.0 x 10^(-10) m. \n\nStep 2) We calculate the diameter, d, of the nitrogen molecule which is twice of its radius, d = 2r = 2 x 1 x 10^(-10) = 2 x 10^(-10) m.\n\nStep 3) The molecular mass of nitrogen, M, is given as 28.0 g which we convert to the SI unit of kilograms (kg) using the relation 1 g = 10^(-3) kg. Hence M = 28 x 10^(-3) kg.\n\nStep 4) We calculate the root mean square speed, Vrms, of the nitrogen molecules using the relation Vrms = \u221a(3RT / M), where, R is the universal gas constant = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1. Upon substituting the known values into this equation, we get Vrms = \u221a(3 x 8.314 x 290 / (28 x 10^-3)) = 508.26 m/s.\n\nStep 5) We calculate the mean free path (l) using the relation l = kT / \u221a(2 x \u03c0 x d^2 x P), where k is the Boltzmann constant = 1.38 x 10^(-23) kg m^2 s^-2 K^-1.

        "Question": "11. A metre-long narrow bore held horizontally (and closed at one end) contains a 76 cm long mercury thread, which traps a 15 cm column of air. What happens if the tube is held vertically with the open end at the bottom?",
        "Original Solution": "Length of the narrow bore, L = 1 m = 100 cm\r\nLength of the mercury thread, l = 76 cm\r\nLength of the air column between mercury and the closed end, la = 15 cm\r\nSince the bore is held vertically in the air with the open end at the bottom, the mercury length that occupies the air space is\r\n= 100 \u2013 (76 + 15)\r\n= 9 cm\r\nTherefore,\r\nThe total length of the air column = 15 + 9 = 24 cm\r\nLet h cm of mercury flow out as a result of atmospheric pressure.\r\nSo,\r\nLength of the air column in the bore = 24 + h cm\r\nAnd,\r\nLength of the mercury column = 76 \u2013 h cm\r\nInitial pressure, V1 = 15 cm^3\r\nFinal pressure, P2 = 76 \u2013 (76 \u2013 h)\r\n= h cm of mercury\r\nFinal volume, V2 = (24 + h) cm^3\r\nThe temperature remains constant throughout the process.\r\nTherefore,\r\nP1V1 = P2V2\r\nOn substituting, we get\r\n76 x 15 = h (24 + h)\r\nh2 + 24h \u2013 11410 = 0\r\nSolving further, we get\r\n= 23.8 cm or -47.8 cm\r\nSince height cannot be negative. Hence, 23.8 cm of mercury will flow out from the bore.\r\nLength of the air column = 24 + 23.8 = 47.8 cm",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by identifying the important values given in the problem, the length of the entire bore tube is stated as 1 meter, but for this problem, we will convert it to 100 cm to keep consistent units. The mercury thread and air column lengths are given as 76 cm and 15 cm, respectively. Step 2) Consider the scenario when the tube is held vertical with its open end at the bottom. We need to find the effectiveness of the trapped air space which is obtained from the total length of the bore tube decreased by both the mercury thread and air column. This will result in a 9 cm void. Step 3) Additionally, when held vertically, the length of the air column will increase by these 9 cm, totaling 24 cm. Step 4) Consider an unknown amount 'h' cm of mercury displaced due to atmospheric pressure. This will alter both the air and the mercury column lengths to 24 + h cm and 76 - h cm respectively. Step 5) Now correlate everything using Boyle's law (P1V1 = P2V2) which applies here since temperature is constant throughout the process. The initial pressure corresponds to 15 cm (taking one dimension length as the volume) and the final pressure (P2) is obtained given the final height of the mercury column, which is meant by h cm. The final volume (V2) is the final length of the air column which comes out to (24 + h) cm. Step 6) Substituting these values into the Boyle's law equation gives us a quadratic equation in terms of 'h'. Step 7) Using basic algebraic knowledge, solve the quadratic equation to find 'h'. We obtain the two roots, 23.8 cm or -47.8 cm. Step 8) Since 'h', representing a length, can't be negative, discard the negative value, so 23.8 cm of mercury flows out. Step 9) Add this value to the length of the air column calculated in Step 3, so we get our final air column length as 47.8 cm.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given data and convert length to a uniform measure (cm). Step 2) Consider the tube held vertically, verify how much space the air and mercury occupy. Step 3) Determine the new length of the air column when the tube is vertical. Step 4) Acknowledge that an unknown amount 'h' cm of mercury will be influenced due to atmospheric pressure, thus modifying the lengths of both the air and the mercury column. Step 5) Apply Boyle's Law, implying a constant temperature to build an equation using the given and new circumstances. Step 6) Solve for 'h' by substituting the lengths of the present air and mercury columns into the equation. Step 7) Resolve the quadratic equation of 'h'. Step 8) Recognize 'h' as a length, and hence discard the negative root. Determine the amount of mercury displaced. Step 9) Add this value to the initially calculated length of the air column to get the final answer."

Step 2) We are asked to identify this unknown gas. To do this, we can make use of the Graham's Law of diffusion. This law suggests an inverse relationship between the rate of diffusion of a gas and the square root of its molar mass. The formula is typically expressed as R1 / R2 = (M2 / M1)^0.5, where M1 and M2 are the molar mass of the first and second gas, respectively. Step 3) To find the molar mass of the unknown gas (M2), we rearrange our formula to isolate M2: M2 = M1 (R1 / R2)^2. Step 4) Hydrogen's molar mass (M1) is known and is equal to 2.020g. We substitute the known values of M1, R1, and R2 into our equation: M2 = 2.02 (28.7 / 7.2)^2. Step 5) We perform the calculation to find M2 = 32.09g. Step 6) We round this to the closest integer value to get 32g. Step 7) Recognizing molar masses from the periodic table, we find that a molecular gas with a molar mass of 32g is Oxygen. Therefore, the unknown gas is oxygen.",

Step 5) Calculate M2 to find it to be around 32g. Step 6) From the Periodic Table, a molecular mass of 32g corresponds to Oxygen. Therefore, the unknown gas must be Oxygen."

It does not come backward. Therefore, this motion is not periodic.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are firstly provided with four scenarios and asked to determine which of these represent periodic motion. So, we need to understand what periodic motion is. Periodic motion is one that repeats itself at regular intervals or periods. This means, the object in motion returns to its initial position after a fixed time period. It can include to-and-fro motion (or oscillation), circular motion, etc. Step 2) 'A' represents a swimmer making a return trip from one bank of a river to the other. While this is a to-and-fro motion, it doesn't qualify as a periodic motion. Reason being, the time taken by the swimmer to travel from bank to bank may not be the same always due to factors such as the strength of the current, the swimmer's stamina, etc., and hence lacks a definite time period. Step 3) 'B' describes a situation of a bar magnet suspended freely and displaced from its North-South direction before being released. In this case, the magnet tends to come back to its initial position (due to Earth's magnetic field) after being displaced, and this back-and-forth motion repeats after a certain time period. So, this scenario does represent periodic motion. Step 4) 'C' considers a hydrogen molecule rotating about its centre of mass. If we consider the rotation motion, the molecule returns to its original orientation after each full rotation, which happens at regular intervals of time. Thus, this is also a form of periodic motion. Step 5) 'D' relates to an arrow being released from a bow. Once shot, the arrow moves in a forward direction and doesn't return to its original position. There is no motion repeating after regular intervals. Hence, this is not a periodic motion.",

Step 4) Look at the rotational motion of the hydrogen molecule in option 'C' and conclude that since it returns to the same position after each full rotation, it's a type of periodic motion.

Simple Harmonic Motion is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement.\nStep 2) For (a) the rotation of the Earth about its axis, we observe that it isn't motion about a fixed point, and there doesn't exist a restoring force that's proportional to the displacement. The Earth's rotation is definitely a periodic motion as it repeats itself after a specified interval (one day), but it lacks qualities to be Simple Harmonic.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is asking us to classify several functions of time into three categories: simple harmonic motion, which is a type of periodic motion characterized by a sinusoidal waveform; periodic but non-simple harmonic motion, which repeats over time but not in a sinusoidal fashion; and non-periodic motion, which doesn't repeat over time. Step 2) For function (a), we first express sin\u03c9t - cos\u03c9t as \u221a2 [(1/\u221a2) sin\u03c9t- (1/\u221a2) cos\u03c9t]. This is essentially converting the sum of sin and cos into a single sine function by applying the formula sin(a+b) = sin(a)cos(b) - cos(a)sin(b). As a result, we have \u221a2 [sin\u03c9t \u2013 (\u03c0/4)]. Since this is a sine function, it represents a simple harmonic motion with a period of 2\u03c0/\u03c9. Step 3) Function (b) is sin^3(\u03c9t)=1/4[3sin \u03c9t\u2212sin 3\u03c9t]. This function can be broken down into two sinusoidal components: sin \u03c9t and sin 3\u03c9t. Even though each component individually represents simple harmonic motion, their superposition is periodic but not simple harmonic. The overall period here is 2\u03c0/\u03c9. Step 4) Function (c) is 3cos[\u03c0/4 -2\u03c9t] which can be rewritten as 3cos[2\u03c9t - \u03c0/4] by applying trigonometric identities. Like in step 2 and 3, it can be identified as a cosine function and hence it is a simple harmonic motion with a period of \u03c0/\u03c9. Step 5) Function (d) can be broken down into three simple harmonic motions with periods of 2\u03c0/\u03c9, 2\u03c0/3\u03c9, and 2\u03c0/5\u03c9 respectively. The superposition of these three components is periodic but not simple harmonic. Step 6) Function (e) is exp(-\u03c9^2 t^2). This is an exponential function that doesn't repeat over time, so it's considered non-periodic motion. Step 7) Function (f) is 1+\u03c9t+\u03c9^2 t^2 it is non-periodic as it doesn't exhibit any repetitive pattern over a specified interval.",

The particle is moving in a simple harmonic motion (SHM), its extremities being A and B. In the SHM, there's a point of equilibrium or the mid-point, denoted as 'O'. Step 2) For point A, observe that the particle momentarily comes to rest at the extremities in SHM, hence the velocity is Zero. The acceleration and force are directed towards the mean position which in this scenario is in the direction from A to B, hence they are Positive. Step 3) For point B, as with A, the velocity is Zero. However, in this case, the acceleration and force are directed towards the mean position which is in the direction from B to A, contrary to our defined positive direction, hence both are Negative. Step 4) At mid-point 'O', the particle will be moving at its highest velocity which is directed towards A, hence is Negative. The acceleration and force at the mid-point in SHM are both Zero since the particle is at equilibrium or the mean position.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by identifying the known values. Here, those variables are 'a' for acceleration and 'x' for displacement. Notice that we have four given equations that represent four relationships between a and x. Step 2) We need to understand the simple harmonic motion (SHM) condition which states that acceleration is directly proportional to the negative of displacement. Mathematically this is represented by a = -kx, where k is a constant. Now we need to compare each equation given in options (a), (b), (c), and (d) with the standard SHM equation 'a = -kx' to identify which equations represent SHM. Step 3) Let's look at option (a), a = 0.7x. However, putting it into the form of a = -kx, we would have to let k = -0.7. This is not possible, as k has to be positive. Hence, this equation does not represent SHM. Step 4) Moving to option (b), a = -200x^2. The exponent on x (which is 2) disqualifies this equation from being SHM as it's not exactly in the format of 'a=-kx' where k is a positive constant. Hence, this equation does not represent SHM. Step 5) Now, looking at option (c), a = -10x. If you compare this with a = -kx, it implies that k = 10. This fits the condition of SHM, meaning that this equation does represent SHM. Step 6) Finally, let's take option (d), a = 100x^3. This doesn't fit into our SHM equation a = -kx either. The exponent on x in this equation is 3, disqualifying this equation from being SHM. Hence, this equation does not represent SHM. From the evaluations, we can conclude that the only viable candidate for simple harmonic motion is the equation from option (c)",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) First, recognize the known variables which are 'a' for acceleration and 'x' for displacement. Notice four different given equations that show relationships between a and x. Step 2) Remember that Simple Harmonic Motion is represented by the formula a = -kx, where k is a constant. We'll systematically compare each given equation to this standard formula. Step 3) The equation a = 0.7x in option (a) doesn't match the standard SHM formula, because here k would have to be -0.7, but k must be positive. Hence, option (a) does not represent SHM. Step 4) Option (b) has an equation a = -200x^2, which isn't in the standard SHM form due to the square on the x. Therefore, (b) does not represent SHM. Step 5) Looking at option (c), a = -10x is exactly in the form 'a=-kx' fulfilling the condition for SHM. So, option (c) represents SHM. Step 6) And finally, the equation a = 100x^3 in option (d) is not of the SHM form due to the cubic on the x. Hence, (d) isn't SHM. In conclusion, only option (c) satisfies the condition for SHM."

Step 2) The initial position and velocity of the particle are stated in the problem: at time t = 0, the displacement x(0) is 1 cm and the velocity v is \u03c9 cm/s. Step 3) Substituting these initial conditions into the displacement function, we get A cos \u03d5 = 1. This equation comes from cos(0) = 1.

We know that the scale can read a maximum mass, M = 50 kg, and the length of the scale, is also equal to maximum displacement of the spring l = 20 cm which needs to be converted into meters resulting in 0.2 m. The body oscillates with a given period, T = 0.6 s. \nStep 2) We can establish that the maximum force exerted on the spring, F relates to the maximum mass that the scale can read through the gravitational force equation F = mg. Here, g stands for acceleration due to gravity, which is generally accepted to be 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\nStep 3) Proceed to calculate the force by multiplying max mass and acceleration due to gravity, F = 50 kg x 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 490 N.\nStep 4) Using this force F, we can then find the spring constant, k, which is calculated as the force F divided by length l, i.e., k = F / l = 490 N / 0.2 m = 2450 N m^-1. \nStep 5) Recall that the mass (m) of the body can be calculated considering that it's suspended from the balance.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides us with two main pieces of information: the stroke of the piston is 1.0 m, and it moves with an angular frequency (\u03c9) of 200 rad/min. A stroke refers to the distance the piston travels, and it is usually twice the amplitude of a harmonic motion. The angular frequency is related to how fast the oscillation is. Step 2) The amplitude, A, is understood as half of the stroke in harmonic motion, as the stroke is defined as a complete cycle of oscillation from one extreme, through the less extreme to the other extreme. In this case, A = 1.0 m / 2 = 0.5 m. Step 3) The maximum speed (vmax) of an oscillating object, such as our piston, in simple harmonic motion is given by the equation: vmax = A\u03c9. This means the top speed is the product of the amplitude and the angular frequency. Step 4) We can now substitute the known values of A = 0.5 m and \u03c9 = 200 rad/min into this relation. vmax = A\u03c9 = 200 rad/min * 0.5 m = 100 m/min.

        "Question": "16. Answer the following questions :(a) Time period of a particle in SHM depends on the force constant k and mass m of the particle:T = = 2\u03c0 (\u221am/\u221ak)A simple pendulum executes SHM approximately. Why then is the time period of a pendulum independent of the mass of the pendulum?\r\n(b) The motion of a simple pendulum is approximately simple harmonic for small-angle oscillations. For larger angles of oscillation, a more involved analysis shows that T is greater than 2\u03c0(\u221al/\u221ag).

Does the watch give the correct time during the free fall?\r\n(d) What is the frequency of oscillation of a simple pendulum mounted in a cabin that is freely falling under gravity?",
        "Original Solution": "(a)  In the case of a simple pendulum, the spring constant k is proportional to the mass. The m is the numerator and the denominator will cancel each other. Therefore, the time period of the simple pendulum is independent of the mass of the bob.\r\n(b) The restoring force acting on the bob of a simple pendulum is given by the expression\r\nF=\u2212mgsin\u03b8\r\nF is the restoring force\r\nm is the mass of the bob\r\ng is the acceleration due to gravity\r\n\u03b8 is the angle of displacement\r\nWhen \u03b8 is small, sin\u03b8\u2248\u03b8.\r\nThen the expression for the time period of a simple pendulum is given by T=2\u03c0(\u221al/\u221ag)\r\nWhen \u03b8 is large, sin\u03b8<\u03b8.

Therefore, the watch will show the correct time.\r\n(d) During the free fall of the cabin, the acceleration due to gravity will be zero. Therefore the frequency of oscillation of the simple pendulum will also be zero.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Upon given the formula for the time period of a particle in simple harmonic motion (SHM) as T = 2\u03c0 (\u221am/\u221ak), we gather that the time period T depends on both the force constant k and the mass m of the particle. We need to determine why, when it comes to a simple pendulum (which executes SHM), the time period T doesn't rely on the mass of the pendulum. Looking into the formula, the mass (m) and the force constant (k) appear in ratio under the square root. If any system possesses a force constant proportional to its mass (like in the case of a pendulum), the effect of mass in the ratio \u221am/\u221ak will cancel out, since the mass in numerator and denominator nullify each other. This explains why the time period of a simple pendulum is independent of its mass. \nStep 2) The time period of a simple pendulum can be formulated as T=2\u03c0(\u221al/\u221ag) where 'l' represents the length of the pendulum and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity. The derivation of this formula makes certain assumptions - one being that the pendulum oscillates in such small angles that the sin\u03b8 is approximately equal to \u03b8. When the pendulum oscillates in larger angles, these assumptions do not hold any longer, making the derived formula invalid. In such cases, sin\u03b8 itself is less than \u03b8 which leads to an increase in the time period T of the pendulum. \nStep 3) When a man with a wristwatch falls from a tower, we need to determine whether the watch will show the correct time during the fall. The wristwatch works based on the spring action which is independent of gravitational acceleration. Thus, even during the fall where gravity plays a significant role, the wristwatch isn't affected by it and continues to function normally, showing the correct time. \nStep 4) In case of a simple pendulum being mounted in a freely falling cabin, would it show any frequency of oscillation? In free fall scenarios, the effective gravitational acceleration becomes zero as the cabin is falling with the same acceleration. In the absence of gravitational pull, the pendulum would not oscillate, leading to the frequency of oscillation being zero.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that the time period T = 2\u03c0 (\u221am/\u221ak) given in the question is applicable for a particle in simple harmonic motion (SHM). For a simple pendulum executing SHM, the force constant k is proportional to the mass m. This characteristic property causes cancellation between the mass present in the numerator and denominator, thus making T independent of m. \nStep 2) Understand the assumptions made in calculating the time period of a simple pendulum as T=2\u03c0(\u221al/\u221ag). For small angles of oscillation, as assumed in derivation, sin\u03b8 is approximated to \u03b8. But for larger angles, sin\u03b8 becomes less than \u03b8, which hence invalidates the formula and increases the time period. \nStep 3) Acknowledge the fact that a wristwatch works on spring action, which is unaffected by gravity. So, even in free fall scenarios where gravity plays a significant role, the wristwatch shows the correct time. \nStep 4) During free fall, as in the case of a cabin, it maintains zero acceleration with respect to gravitational pull. In such a scenario, a pendulum inside the cabin would not oscillate, resulting in zero frequency."

If the pendulum makes small oscillations in a radial direction about its equilibrium position, what will be its time period?",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by understanding what is happening in this problem. The bob of the simple pendulum is in a car. This car is going in a circle at uniform speed. Hence, the bob is experiencing two accelerations: the regular gravity (downwards) and the centripetal acceleration (towards the center of the circular path of the car). These two accelerations are perpendicular to each other. Step 2) We need to calculate both accelerations. The acceleration due to gravity is given as g. But since the car is also moving in a circular path, there is a centripetal acceleration which equals v^2 / R where v is the uniform speed of the car and R is the radius of the track. Step 3) These two individual accelerations can together be understood as a single net or 'effective acceleration'. We denote this as g'. We calculate g' by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the two individual accelerations. This is taken from the Pythagorean theorem, as these accelerations form a right-angle triangle. Hence g\u2019 = \u221a(g^2 + (v^4 / R^2)). Step 4) After finding the effective acceleration, we use it to calculate the time period of our pendulum. The time period formula for a simple pendulum is t = 2\u03c0\u221al / g where l is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But since we are considering the effective acceleration, we replace g with g', thus obtaining t = 2\u03c0 \u221a(l / \u221ag^2 + v^4 / R^2).",

Step 2) Identify that in equilibrium, the weight of the cork equals the weight of the liquid displaced by the floating cork. This establishes a balance between the downward force (gravity) and the force exerted by the displaced liquid (buoyancy). This forms the basis of the Fluid Mechanics principle in relation to floating bodies. Step 3) Assume that the cork is depressed slightly by an amount x. When the cork is depressed, the volume of liquid displaced increases, and hence there's an increment in the up-thrust that acts upward creating the restoring force to the cork. Step 4) Define Restoring Force: Up-thrust is equivalent to the restoring force, which we denote as F. This force equals the negative of the weight of the extra water displaced, which is volume times density times gravity. Here, volume is the product of area and the distance through which the cork is depressed, which can be formulated as F = \u2212Ax * \u03c11g (Equation 1).

Solving this equation for k gives us k = F / x = \u2212A\u03c11g (Equation 2).

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by understanding the conditions of the problem. We are given a particle executing simple harmonic motion (SHM), and we are asked to demonstrate that over a period of oscillation, the average kinetic energy (KE) is equal to the average potential energy (PE). This is a typical characterization of simple harmonic motion. The mass of the particle is denoted as 'm'.\n\nStep 2) The displacement of the particle at a specific time, 't', can be represented by 'x = A sin \u03c9t'. Here, 'A' represents the amplitude of the oscillation, and '\u03c9' is the angular frequency.\n\nStep 3) To calculate the kinetic energy, we first need to find the velocity of the particle. We obtain velocity 'v' by differentiating the displacement 'x' with respect to time as 'v= dx/dt = A\u03c9cos \u03c9t'.\n\nStep 4) The instantaneous kinetic energy in terms of 'm', 'A', '\u03c9', and 't' is given by 'K = (1/2) mv\u00b2 = (1/2) m (A\u03c9cos \u03c9t)\u00b2 = (1/2) m (A\u00b2\u03c9\u00b2cos\u00b2\u03c9t)'. This equation utilizes the formula for kinetic energy, 'KE = 1/2 mv\u00b2'.\n\nStep 5) To find the average value of kinetic energy over one complete cycle, we integrate the instantaneous kinetic energy 'K' with respect to time from 0 to 'T', where 'T' is the time period. This gives us 'Kav = \u222b (1/2) m A\u00b2\u03c9\u00b2cos\u00b2\u03c9t dt over 0 to T'. After integrating, we find that 'Kav = 1/4 m A\u00b2 \u03c9\u00b2'.\n\nStep 6) Now let's move on to the potential energy. The instantaneous potential energy 'U' is given by 'U = (1/2)kx\u00b2'. Since for SHM, k = m\u03c9\u00b2, 'U' can be rewritten as 'U = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2x\u00b2 = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2A\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03c9t'.\n\nStep 7) Similar to how we found the average kinetic energy, the average potential energy over one complete cycle is given by 'Uav = \u222b (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2A\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03c9t dt over 0 to T'.

In essence, this means that the torsion on the disk is proportional to the angle we twist it by, with the negative sign indicating the force being restorative (i.e. it pushes back against the twist). \n\nStep 3) To find \u03b1, we'll need to use the moment of inertia (I). This moment can be calculated for a circular disk as I = (1/2) mR2.

We start with identifying our known variables. We have the amplitude as 5 cm which we convert to meters for consistency, giving us 0.05 m. We also know the time period is 0.2 s. Step 2) We need to remember the key formulas for acceleration and velocity for harmonic motion. The acceleration formula is A = -\u03c9\u00b2y, and the velocity formula is v = \u03c9\u221a(r\u00b2-y\u00b2). Here, y is the displacement, \u03c9 represents angular velocity, and r is the amplitude. Step 3) We calculate \u03c9, which is the angular velocity, using \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T. Plugging in the time period, T = 0.2 s, we get \u03c9 = 10\u03c0 rad/s. Step 4) For each of the 3 cases, we use the given displacement (the y in our formulas) and calculate acceleration and velocity. (a) With y = 5 cm = 0.05 m, the displacement is equal to the amplitude. Substituting these values into the acceleration equation yields A = -(10\u03c0)\u00b2*(0.05) = 5\u03c0\u00b2 m/s\u00b2. Plugging the same values into the velocity equation, we find that v = 0, as the square root term equals zero. (b) For y = 3 cm = 0.03 m, the displacement is less than the amplitude. Using the same procedure, we find A = - (10\u03c0)\u00b2*(0.03) = 3\u03c0\u00b2 m/s\u00b2 and v = 10\u03c0*\u221a((0.05)\u00b2-(0.03)\u00b2) = 10\u03c0*0.04 = 0.4\u03c0 m/s. (c) Finally, for y = 0, the displacement is zero, so acceleration is also zero (since the displacement term in the acceleration formula become zero). However, velocity for this scenario is not zero (as the displacement term is subtracted in the velocity formula). Plugging in the values, we get v = 10\u03c0*\u221a((0.05)\u00b2-0) = 10\u03c0*0.05 = 0.5\u03c0 m/s.",

The displacement of the spring can be represented by the equation x = a cos (\u03c9t+\u03b8), where a is the amplitude, the maximum distance the spring can move away from its equilibrium position. Step 2) We are told that at t = 0, the displacement of the spring is x0. This means we can input these values into our x equation, resulting in x0 = a cos \u03b8. This represents the initial condition of the system. Step 3) The velocity v of the spring at any point in time can be given as the derivative of the displacement equation, which gives v = -a\u03c9 sin (\u03c9t+\u03b8). We are told that the initial velocity at t = 0 is -v0, which we input into this equation, resulting in -v0 = -a\u03c9 sin \u03b8. We then simplify this to get Asin \u03b8 =  v0/\u03c9.

These are: the mass of the string (M) which equals 2.50 kg, the tension in the string (T) which equals 200 N, and the length of the string (l) which equals 20.0 m.

In mathematical terms, we perform \u03bc = M / l, resulting in 0.125 kg / m. This calculation gives us the density of the string - showing how much mass it contains in each metre. Step 3) We then use the formula for the velocity of the transverse wave (v). This formula is v = \u221a(T / \u03bc). The velocity of a wave is determined by the root of the tension divided by the mass density. Higher tension and lower density will result in a faster wave. Step 4) By plugging in the given tension (200 N) and our calculated mass per unit length (0.125 kg / m) into the equation, we get v = \u221a(200 / 0.125). This results in a wave velocity of 40 m/s. Step 5) Lastly, we know that the disturbance travels at the speed of the wave and therefore the time it takes to reach the other side is simply the length (20m) divided by the wave's velocity (40 m/s).

These are pieces of information provided in the problem and will be used to find the solution. Step 2) Let's consider 't' to be the time taken by the stone to hit the water\u2019s surface. This part is crucial because we're dealing with two different time frames: the fall of the stone and the travel of the sound wave. Step 3) You can use the equations of motion to figure out the time it takes for the stone to fall. In this case, the equation 's = ut + 0.5gt\u00b2' is relevant. The 's' represents distance (the height of the tower), 'u' is the initial velocity, 't' is time, 'g' is gravity and the 0.5 is a constant that comes from integrating acceleration to get the distance covered. Step 4) Insert the values into the equation to get '300 = 0 + 0.5 x 9.8 x t\u00b2'. As given, the initial velocity is zero, so the ut term is zero. Solve for 't' to find that 't = 7.82 s'. This tells us how long the stone was falling. Step 5) Next, calculate the time it takes for the sound of the splash to reach the top of the tower. Use the formula for speed, which is 'Speed = Distance / Time', rearranged here as 'Time = Distance / Speed'. This gives us 't\u2019= 300/340 = 0.88 s'. This is important because the speed of sound determines how long it takes for the splash sound to reach the top. Step 6) In the final step, add the time it takes for the stone to fall and the time for the sound to travel to get 't + t\u2019 = 7.82 s + 0.88 s = 8.7 seconds'.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides the formula for the velocity of sound in a gas or air, as v = sqrt(\u03b3P/\u03c1). In this formula, 'v' is the velocity of sound, '\u03b3' is the adiabatic index, 'P' is the pressure, and '\u03c1' is the density. Step 2) We begin to solve it by referencing the ideal gas equation: PV = nRT or PV = RT(m/M), where 'n' is number of moles, 'R' is the gas constant, 'T' is the temperature, 'm' is the total mass, and 'M' is the molecular mass of the gas. Step 3) We can rearrange the ideal gas equation to get P = \u03c1RT/M, indicating that the pressure is equal to the density times the gas constant times the temperature over the molecular mass. Step 4) This means that P/\u03c1 = RT/M. Step 5) As for the speed of sound, we can replace P/\u03c1 in the original formula with RT/M, so v = sqrt(\u03b3RT/M). This shows the relationship between the speed of sound, temperature, the gas constant, the adiabatic index, and the molar mass of the gas.

When temperature increases, the speed of sound does too. Step 8) In part c), when the humidity increases, it actually decreases overall air density due to water vapor (which is less dense than dry air).

Step 5) Under constant temperature, P/\u03c1 becomes a constant, showing that pressure does not influence the speed of sound (part a). Step 6) From the derived formula, we understand that the speed of sound increases with temperature (part b), as v is proportional to the square root of T.

We know that the frequency of the ultrasonic sound (\u03bd) emitted by the bat is 1000 kHz or 10^6 Hz (since 1 kHz is equal to 10^3 Hz). We also know that the speed of sound in air (vA) is 340 m/s and in water (vW) it is 1486 m/s. \n\nStep 2) Now, to figure out the wavelength of the reflected sound (\u03bbR) in the air, we need to remember the fundamental formula related to wave theory, which is \u03bb = v/\u03bd, where v is the speed of the wave, and \u03bd is the frequency.

We know that a MHz is a unit of frequency equal to one million (10^6) cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). So, we convert 4.2 MHz to Hz by multiplying 4.2 by 10^6, which gives us 4.2 \u00d7 10^6 Hz.\nStep 2) Next, we are given the speed of sound in the tissue as 2 km/s. Since we are dealing with physics and the standard unit of speed is meter per second (m/s), we convert 2 km/s to m/s.

Step 2) From this, we use the equation for phase difference \u03a6 = kx = 2\u03c0/ \u03bb.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Recognize the structure of a stationary wave. From our studies, we know that the standard equation of a stationary wave is expressed as y (x, t) = 2a sin(kx) cos(wt). When we look at the given equation y (x, t) = 0.06sin(2\u03c0/3x)cos(120\u03c0t), we can see it matches the structure of our known stationary wave equation, except the amplitude is 0.06 instead of 2a. So, the given wave function describes a stationary wave. Step 2) The wave can be interpreted as the superposition of two waves traveling in opposite directions. We know that a wave traveling in the positive x-direction can be represented as y1 = a sin(wt - kx) and a wave traveling in the negative x-direction is represented as y2 = a sin(wt + kx). When we superposition these two waves, y = y1 + y2, we get the expression -2asin(kx)cos(wt) which is similar to our given wire displacement equation.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with the given functions and aim to figure out which ones represent a stationary wave, a travelling wave, and neither of the two. The three scenarios are characterised differently. For a stationary wave, the harmonic terms \u03c9t and kx appear separately. For a travelling wave, these terms combine as (kx \u2013 \u03c9t) or (kx + \u03c9t). If neither of these characteristics is fulfilled, the function doesn't describe either type of wave. Step 2) Looking at the first function y = 3 sin( 5x \u2013 0.5t ) + 4cos( 5x \u2013 0.5t ), we see that our arguments in both sin and cos functions are in the form of (kx - \u03c9t). This complies to the characteristics of a travelling wave. Therefore, (i) expresses a travelling wave. Step 3) Examining the second function y = cosx sint + cos2x sin2t, we see that it's a superposition of two harmonic terms, where the arguments kx and \u03c9t appear separately. According to our known characteristics, this configuration depicts a stationary wave. So, (ii) represents a stationary wave. Step 4) For the third equation, y = 2 cos (3x) sin (10t), the arguments of our trigonometric functions appear separately, indicating a stationary wave. Therefore, (iii) also portrays a stationary wave.

The linear mass density of the string is 4.0 \u00d7 10^-2 kg/ m, and its mass is 2 \u00d7 10^-2 kg. Calculate:\r\n(i) The velocity of a transverse wave on the string\r\n(ii) The tension in the string",
        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass of the string, m = 2 x 10^-2 kg\r\nLinear density of the string = 4 x 10^-2 kg\r\nFrequency, vF = 45 Hz\r\nWe know the length of the wire = m/\u00b5\r\n= (2 x 10^-2)/ (4 x 10^-2) = 0.5 m\r\nWe know, \u03bb = 2l/n\r\nWhere, n = number of nodes in the wire.\r\nFor the fundamental node, n =1\r\n=> \u03bb = 2l\r\n= 2 x 0.5 = 1m\r\n(i) Therefore, the speed of the transverse wave, v = \u03bb vF\r\n= 1 x 45 = 45 m/s.\r\n(ii) Tension in the string = \u00b5 v^2\r\n= 4 x10^-2 x 45 = 81",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by noting the given values from the problem. The mass of the string is 2 x 10^-2 kg, its linear mass density is 4 x 10^-2 kg/m, and the frequency at which it vibrates in its fundamental mode is 45 Hz. \n\nStep 2) First, you need to calculate the length of the string. This is done using the formula l = m/\u00b5, where m is the mass and \u00b5 is the linear density of the string. Substituting the given values into the formula gives l = (2 x 10^-2) / (4 x 10^-2) = 0.5 m. It's an important property of the string that also determines how the waves move on it.\n\nStep 3) Next, you need to determine the wavelength of the wave produced when the string is vibrating in its fundamental mode. This can be calculated using the formula \u03bb = 2l/n, where l is the length of the string and n is the number of nodes (regions of zero displacement on a standing wave). In the fundamental, or first mode, there is only one node (n = 1), so the wavelength is \u03bb = 2 * l = 2 * 0.5 = 1 m. The wavelength also describes the distance between repeating units of a wave pattern.\n\nStep 4) Now that you have the wavelength, you can calculate the speed of the transverse wave. The formula to use here is v = \u03bb vF, where vF is the frequency and \u03bb is the wavelength. Substituting in the given and calculated values gives: v = 1 x 45 = 45 m/s. The speed of the wave tells you how fast a point on the wave (like a crest) is moving.\n\nStep 5) Finally, to determine the tension in the string, you can use the equation T = \u00b5 v^2, where \u00b5 is the linear mass density and v is the speed of the wave. Plugging in the given and calculated values gives: T = 4 x10^-2 x 45^2 = 81 N. Tension is the pulling force transmitted along the string.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin by noting the given values in the question: mass, linear mass density, and frequency of vibration. \n\nStep 2) Use the equation for length of the string (l = m/\u00b5) to calculate its length. This value is crucial as it determines the behavior of waves on the string.\n\nStep 3) Calculate the wavelength of the fundamental mode wave using \u03bb = 2l/n. For the fundamental node, we know n = 1. The wavelength describes the length of one full wave cycle. \n\nStep 4) Find the speed of the transverse wave using the equation v = \u03bb vF. Here, you are simply multiplying the wavelength by the frequency.\n\nStep 5) Compute the string tension using the equation T = \u00b5 v^2. This provides the force that's being transmitted along the length of the vibrating string."

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with what the problem provides us. The length of the tube, is 20 cm. But since we're working with the speed of sound, which is typically in meters per second, we convert the length to 0.2 meters. Step 2) The frequency of the sound source is given as 430 Hz. And the speed of sound in air is known at 340 m/s as provided. Step 3) We're first considering the case where one end of the tube is closed. For a closed pipe the frequency of the nth mode is calculated using vN = (2n - 1)v/4l. Here 'v' is the speed of sound, 'n' is the mode number and should be an integer, and 'l' is the length of the tube. Step 4) Substitute the given values into the equation. We get 430 = (2n - 1)(340/0.8). We can solve this equation to determine that the value of 'n' is approximately 1. So, the given sound source would resonantly excite the first mode of frequency. Step 5) Now considering if both ends of the tube are open. In such cases, the frequency for the nth mode is calculated using vR = nv/2l. Step 6) We substitute the values into the equation, which gives n = (2*0.2*430)/340, which simplifies to 0.5. However, for the equation to hold true, 'n' must be an integer. Here, it isn't. It means that when both ends of the tube are open, the same sound source cannot produce resonance.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert given length of tube from cm to m to match units of speed of sound. Step 2) Note down given values of frequency and speed of sound.

Step 4) Solve the equation with given values to determine the frequency mode excited when n\u22481. Step 5) For a tube open at both ends, we use another formula vR=nv/2l to calculate the harmonic mode. Step 6) Substitute values into the equation and solve for 'n'.

        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nFrequency of  X, fX = 324 Hz\r\nFrequency of  Y = fY\r\nBeat\u2019s frequency, n = 6 Hz\r\nAlso,\r\nn = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left | f_{X}\\pm f_{Y} \\right |\\end{array} \\)\r\n6 = \\(\\begin{array}{l}324 \\pm f_{Y}\\end{array} \\)\r\n=> fY = 330 Hz or 318 Hz\r\nAs frequency drops with a decrease in tension in the string, thus fY cannot be 330 Hz\r\n=> fY = 318 Hz.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the given quantities from the problem. The frequency of the string X (fX) is 324 Hz, and the beat frequency (within the tone 'Ga') is initially 6 Hz. The frequency of string Y (fY) is unknown. Step 2) Note the definition of beat frequency, which is the absolute difference in frequencies of two waves: n = | fX \u00b1 fY |. Initially, n = 6. That translates into the equation 6 = | 324 \u00b1 fY |. Step 3) From the above equation, solve for fY. This gives you two possible solutions: 330 Hz and 318 Hz, since the absolute value equation equals to 6 either when fY is added or subtracted from fX. Step 4) Remember that when a guitar string's tension is decreased, the frequency drops. String X was loosened, so its frequency was reduced and the beat frequency subsequently changed to 3 Hz, indicating it was now closer in frequency to string Y. This means that the frequency of string Y has to be lower than the original frequency of X (324 Hz), ruling out the solution of fY = 330 Hz. Thus, fY must be 318 Hz.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify given quantities, namely, fX = 324 Hz, and the initial beat frequency (n) = 6 Hz, and the unknown, fY. Step 2) Understand the principle of beat frequencies that it is the absolute difference of frequencies of two waves combined. So the initial situation gives us the equation, n = 6 = | fX \u00b1 fY | or 6 = | 324 \u00b1 fY |. Step 3) Solve the absolute value equation for fY, yielding two possible solutions: 330 Hz and 318 Hz. Step 4) Utilize the knowledge that if a string's tension decreases, its frequency decreases as well. Given that string X was loosened and it was mentioned that the beat frequency dropped to 3 Hz (closer to fY), we determine that fY must be lower than the original fX (324 Hz). Thus, we discard 330 Hz as the frequency for string Y, leaving us with fY = 318 Hz."

        "Original Solution": "(i) An antinode is a point where pressure is the minimum, and the amplitude of vibration is the maximum. On the other hand, a node is a point where pressure is the maximum, and the amplitude of vibration is the minimum.(ii) The Ganges river dolphin sends out click noises which return back as a vibration, informing the dolphin about the location and distances of objects in front of it. Thus, allowing it to manoeuvre and hunt down prey with minimum vision.(iii) The guitar and the violin produce overtones of different strengths. Thus, one can differentiate between the notes coming from a guitar and a violin, even if they are vibrating at the same frequencies.(iv) Both solids and fluids have a bulk modulus of elasticity. Thus, they both allow longitudinal waves to propagate through them. However, unlike solids, gases do not have a shear modulus. Thus, transverse waves cannot pass through gases.(v) A pulse is a combination of waves of un-similar wavelengths. These waves move at different velocities in a dispersive medium. This causes distortion in its shape.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's begin with the first part of the question concerning sound wave's pressure antinode and displacement node. In wave terms, an antinode is a point where pressure is at its minimum, while simultaneously, the intensity of the wave vibration or amplitude is at its maximum. This is because pressure and amplitude are inversely related. What this means is that where pressure decreases, the physical response or amplitude increases and vice versa. Now, a displacement node is where the physical response or amplitude of the wave is minimum. Thus, a pressure antinode, where amplitude is maximum, coincides with a displacement node, where amplitude is minimum. This is why a sound wave's pressure antinode is a displacement node, and vice versa. \n\nStep 2) Now, let's move onto the second part of the question, about the Ganges river dolphin. Despite being blind, this dolphin can make its way around obstacles and successfully hunt for food. This is possible due to the dolphin's exceptional use of echolocation - a biological sonar. The dolphin sends out 'click' noises, which then reflect off objects in its path and return as vibrations. These vibrations provide the dolphin with information about an object's location, size, and distance, thus helping it navigate and hunt with minimum or no vision. This explains how the Ganges river dolphin can manoeuvre despite its blindness.\n\nStep 3) The third part of the question deals with the differentiation of sounds produced by a guitar and a violin, even when they are played at the same frequency. The fact we can distinguish between these sounds lies in the concept of 'overtones.' Even when the fundamental frequency is the same for both instruments, they produce overtones of differing strengths. This creates a unique tonal color or 'timbre' for each instrument, enabling us to differentiate between their sounds. Thus, even at the same frequencies, we can make out whether a note is being played by a guitar or a violin.\n\nStep 4) The fourth part of the question talks about why both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate through solids, but only longitudinal waves can move through gases. Both solids and fluids share a property known as the 'bulk modulus of elasticity', which permits longitudinal waves to pass through them. However, gases, unlike solids, lack something called a 'shear modulus.' This absence disables transverse waves from passing through gases, meaning only longitudinal waves can. This explains why gases only allow the propagation of longitudinal waves, whereas both wave types can pass through solids.\n\nStep 5) In the final part of the question, we are asked to explain why the shape of a pulse gets distorted as it propagates through a dispersive medium. A pulse is a mix of differing wavelength waves, and these waves do not move at the same speed within a dispersive medium. This unequal movement causes the shape of the pulse to become distorted as it travels.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) A sound wave's pressure antinode is a displacement node, and vice versa, because these terms are inversely related. In other words, where pressure decreases, wave vibration or amplitude increases and vice versa.\n\nStep 2) The Ganges river dolphin can detect objects and hunt despite being blind because it uses echolocation. By emitting 'click' noises and interpreting the returning vibrations, the dolphin gathers data about objects' locations, sizes, and distances.\n\nStep 3) We can tell the difference between a guitar and a violin note played at the same frequency because of 'overtones'. Each instrument produces a distinct combination of overtones even at the same fundamental frequency, giving it a unique tonal color that allows sound differentiation.\n\nStep 4) Both transverse and longitudinal waves can move through solids due to the 'bulk modulus of elasticity,' which gases also possess, allowing for longitudinal waves to pass. However, gases lack a 'shear modulus,' so transverse waves cannot pass through them.\n\nStep 5) The distortion of a pulse as it propagates through a dispersive medium is due to the differing speeds of its component wavelengths, which causes the pulse shape to change."

The Doppler effect formula for frequency is f' = f(v+vo)/(v-vs) where f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer, and vs is the speed of the source. Step 4) For the first scenario, since the observer (platform) is stationary, vo = 0 and vs = -10 m/s (we take it as negative because the direction of source is towards the observer). Substituting these values into the formula, we get the observed frequency when the train is approaching. Step 5) Similarly for the second scenario, vo = 0 but now vs = 10 m/s (positive because the train is receding from the observer). Again, substituting these values into the formula, we can find the observed frequency when the train is receding. Step 6) Regarding the speed of sound, we must understand that the speed of sound in the air does not change regardless of the motion of the source (train in this case). Hence, the speed of sound remains constant at 340 m/s in both the scenarios.",

Step 2) Observe that the question asks for the frequency of the whistle in two different conditions: when the train is approaching and receding from the platform. Step 3) Understand that the change in observed sound frequency is due to the Doppler effect. Introduce the formula for Doppler effect in frequency: f' = f(v+vo)/(v-vs). Step 4) For the first condition where the train is approaching the platform, insert the values into the formula with vo = 0 (stationary observer) and vs = -10 m/s (as the source is moving towards the observer). Compute the observed frequency. Step 5) For the second condition where the train is receding from the platform, use the same formula but now vs = 10 m/s (as the source is moving away from the observer). Calculate the observed frequency. Step 6) Note that the speed of sound remains constant in both scenarios, irrespective of the motion of the source.

The speed of sound in still air can be taken as 340 m s^\u20131.",
        "Original Solution": "Frequency of the whistle = 400 Hz\r\nSpeed of wind, vw= 10 m/s\r\nSpeed of sound in still air,v= 340 m/s\r\nThe effective speed of the sound for an observer standing on the platform\r\nv\u2019 = v + vw = 340 + 10 = 350 m/s\r\nThere is no relative motion between the source and the observer; therefore, the frequency of the sound heard by the observer will be the same.\r\nTherefore, f = 400 Hz\r\nWavelength of the sound heard by the observer = speed of wave/frequency = 350/400 = 0.875 m\r\nWhen the air is still, and the observer runs towards the yard at a speed of 10 m s\u20131, then there is a relative motion between the observer and the source with respect to the medium.\r\nThe medium is at rest.

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by identifying the given information from the problem. The initial frequency of the whistle is 400 Hz, the speed of the wind is 10 m/s, and the speed of sound in still air is 340 m/s.\n Step 2) To find the effective speed of sound for an observer on the platform, we have to sum the speed of sound in still air and the speed of the wind. This is because the wind is blowing in the same direction as the sound, thus making the sound travel faster. So, we add v + vw = 340 m/s + 10 m/s = 350 m/s.\n Step 3) As there is no relative motion between the source of sound (whistle) and observer (person standing on the platform), the frequency of the sound heard by the observer remains the same as the source frequency, which is f = 400 Hz.\n Step 4) Now, we need to calculate the wavelength of the sound heard by the observer. The wavelength is given by the speed of the wave divided by its frequency. Plugging our values in, we get the wavelength as 350 m/s divided by 400 Hz, which is 0.875 m.\n Step 5) The problem also asks to consider the scenario where the air is still, and the observer runs towards the sound source at a speed of 10 m/s. In this case, there is a relative motion of the observer towards the source.\n Step 6) But the medium (air) is at rest, so the effective speed of the sound is the same as the speed of sound in still air, which is v' = v = 340 m/s.\n Step 7) The change in the frequency experienced by the observer can be calculated using the Doppler effect formula, (v + v0)/v x f. Plugging in our values, we get ((340 m/s + 10 m/s) / 340 m/s) x 400 Hz = 411.76 Hz.\n Step 8) Subsequently, we calculate the wavelength of the sound using this modified frequency. The new wavelength = 340 m/s divided by 411.76 Hz, which gives us 0.826 m. \n Step 9) Comparing the results from the two scenarios, it's clear that they are entirely different, contrary what one might intuitively think. The motion of the observer alters the observed frequency and wavelength, even if the relative speed to the source is the same in both scenarios due to the Doppler Effect",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Our first task is to understand the wave equation given, which is y(x, t) = 7.5 sin (0.0050x +12t + \u03c0/4). This is the general form of the wave equation for a wave traveling in the positive x direction. Here, the amplitude of the wave is 7.5 cm (a) and the wave varied with the spatial position (x) and time (t).  The arguments of the 'sin' function can tell us the various properties of the wave including the wave speed, wave number, phase of the wave etc. Step 2) We are tasked to find out the displacement and velocity of oscillation of a point at x = 1 cm and t = 1 s. For displacement, simply plug in the given x and t into the wave function, where we obtain 7.5 sin (0.0050 * (1) +12 * (1) + \u03c0/4) which after some simplification gives 7.5 sin (12.0050 + \u03c0/4). After converting to degrees, we find the angle to be 733.18\u2070. We then reduce this to the range within 360 degrees and calculate the 'sin' of the angle to determine the displacement to be 1.71 cm. Step 3) For the velocity of the point, we differentiate the displacement with respect to time and get 90 cos (733.18). Using a similar method as in step 2, we simplify it to get 90 cos 13.18 and calculate the 'cos' of the angle to find the velocity to be 87.63 cm/s. Step 4) To compare this velocity with the wave propagation velocity, we first need to understand the properties of the given wave. We start by comparing given wave equation to standard sinusoidal wave equation and from it the wave number k and angular frequency \u03c9 is 0.0050 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 12 rad/s, respectively. Using these, we calculate the wavelength \u03bb to be 400 \u03c0 and frequency f to be 6/\u03c0. Wave speed is given as the product of frequency and wavelength which we found to be 2400 cm/s which is much larger than the oscillation speed at a point. Thus, the velocity of the oscillating point is not equal to the wave propagation velocity. Step 5) Now, we are asked in the second part of the question to locate the points of the string which have the same transverse displacements and velocity. This is possible at the points displaced by multiple of wavelengths from the given point. So, we calculate the wavelength as \u03bb=2\u03c0/k=(2\u00d73.14)/0.0050 = 12.56 m and hence the points \u00b112.56m, \u00b125.12m,\u2026 and so on from x = 1 cm, will have the same displacement and velocity.",

        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem involves understanding certain characteristics about a narrow sound pulse. Specifically, the sound pulse has a definite frequency, wavelength, and speed of propagation. Recognize that these terms are key elements of sound waves and relate to their fundamental properties. Step 2) The speed of propagation is determined by the medium through which the sound travels. In this case, the speed equals the speed of the sound in air by default. This speed is fixed and doesn't depend on the properties of the sound wave. Step 3) The frequency and wavelength of the sound, on the other hand, are not definite. They depend on the nature of the pulse signal itself, rather than the medium through which the sound travels. Recall the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of sound: Speed = Frequency x Wavelength. But here, the pulse is narrow and the duration is inconsistent, so the frequency and wavelength are not specific. Step 4) For part (b) of the problem, we need to understand the difference between the frequency of the note produced by the whistle and the frequency of repetition of the whistle sound. The pulse rate is given as 1 every 20 seconds, which means the whistle sound is produced every 20 seconds, but this does not define the frequency of the note produced. The frequency of the note is defined by the wave properties of the sound, not by the repetition rate. So, this means the frequency of the note produced by the whistle is not 0.05 Hz as one might intuitively think. Rather, the 0.05 Hz refers to the frequency of repetition of the whistle sound.",

The time taken by the S and P waves to reach the position of the seismograph is t1 and t2, respectively\r\nl = v1t1 = v2t2\r\nThe speed of S wave, v1=4.0 km s^\u20131\r\nThe speed of P wave, v2= 8.0 km s^\u20131\r\n4t1 = 8t2\r\nt1 = 2t2\r\nThe first P wave arrives 4 min before the S wave.\r\nt1 \u2013 t2 = 4 min = 4 x 60 s = 240 s\r\n2t2 \u2013 t2 = 240 s\r\nt2 = 240 s\r\nt1 = 2t2 = 2 x 240 = 480 s\r\nTherefore, the distance at which the earthquake occurs, l = v1t1 = 4 x 480 = 1920 km.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Assign the speeds of the S and P waves as v1 and v2, respectively. This allows us to differentiate between the two types of waves since they have different speeds. In this scenario, v1=4.0 km s^\u20131 and v2=8.0 km s^\u20131. Step 2) Define the time taken by these waves as t1 for the S wave and t2 for the P wave. This will allow us to establish an equation in terms of these variables. Step 3) We know that the distance traveled by the wave is equivalent to speed multiplied by time. Applying this knowledge, we can form the equation l = v1t1 = v2t2 where l represents the distance of the earthquake. Step 4) Substitute v1 and v2 with their respective values to get the equation 4t1 = 8t2. Rearrange this to get the relationship between t1 and t2, resulting in t1 = 2t2. This equation is telling us that the time taken for the S wave to reach the seismograph is twice the time taken by the P wave. Step 5) It is mentioned that the P wave arrives 4 minutes before the S wave, that is, the difference of their time is 4 minutes or 240 seconds. Hence, we set t1 \u2013 t2 = 240s which eventually gives t2 = 240s by substituting the relationship of t1 and t2 from our previous step. Step 6) We substitute back t2 in the equation t1 = 2t2 to get t1 = 480s. Step 7) Finally, we use the distance formula, l = v1t1, substituting the values of v1 and t1 to get l = 1920km which represents the distance the earthquake occurred.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Start by assigning the speeds of the S and P waves to the variables v1 and v2 respectively. Step 2) Define the time variables, t1 for the S wave and t2 for the P wave. Step 3) Develop an initial equation for distance l, given by l = v1t1 = v2t2. Step 4) From the given wave speed values, derive an equation relating t1 and t2, which is t1 = 2t2. Step 5) Use the given that the P wave arrives 4 minutes before the S wave, thus t1 \u2013 t2 = 240s. Solve this equation to get t2 = 240s. Step 6) Substitute t2 back into the equation derived in Step 4 to get t1. Step 7) Substitute the values of v1 and t1 into the distance formula l = v1t1 to finally conclude that the distance the earthquake occurred is 1920km."

        "Question": "Q27. A bat is flitting about in a cave, navigating via ultrasonic beeps. Assume that the sound emission frequency of the bat is 40 kHz. During one fast swoop directly toward a flat wall surface, the bat is moving at 0.03 times the speed of sound in the air. What frequency does the bat hear reflected off the wall?",
        "Original Solution": "The sound emission frequency of the bat = 40 kHz\r\nThe velocity of the bat, vb = 0.03 v\r\nWhere v is the velocity of the sound in the air\r\nThe apparent frequency of the sound hitting the wall\r\n= 40/0.97 kHz\r\nThe frequency gets reflected by the wall and is received by the bat moving towards the wall\r\n= (1.03 x 40 /0.97) = 42.47 kHz.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We know that the sound emission frequency of the bat is 40 kHz. This is the frequency at which the bat is able to emit sounds. Step 2) Also, we know that the velocity of the bat is 0.03 times the speed of sound in the air, denoted as vb = 0.03v. The 'v' here denotes the velocity of sound in air. This is to emphasize that the bat's speed is equivalent to a fraction of the general speed of sound. Step 3) Now, consider the bat is emitting sound while moving towards the wall. The moving bat causes a Doppler shift in the frequency heard by the wall. This can be calculated by the formula 40 kHz / 0.97, which gives the apparent frequency of the sound when it hits the wall. Step 4) The sound wave that hits the wall is then reflected back towards the bat. Given that the bat is moving towards the wall, this reflected sound wave is again Doppler shifted. To find the frequency that the bat hears, we multiply the previous frequency (40/0.97 kHz) by a factor of 1.03, getting approximately 42.47 kHz. This is the frequency of the sound the bat hears reflected off the wall.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We start with the given bat's emission frequency of 40 kHz and the fact that the bat's speed is 0.03 times the speed of sound in air. Step 2) The sound emitted by the bat hits the wall with a Doppler-shifted frequency, which we calculate using the formula 40 kHz / 0.97. Step 3) When this sound wave is reflected off the wall and reaches the bat, it undergoes another Doppler shift due to the bat's motion towards the wall. Step 4) We compute the final frequency the bat hears as (1.03 x 40 / 0.97) kHz, which is approximately 42.47 kHz. This makes use of the principle of the Doppler Effect, modeling how observed frequencies change when the source or the observer are moving."

        "Question": "Q28. A man standing at a certain distance from an observer blows a horn of frequency 200 Hz in still air. (a) Find the horn\u2019s frequency for the observer when the man (i) runs towards him at 20 m/s  (ii) runs away from him at 20 m /s.\r\n(b) Find the speed of sound in both cases.\r\n[Speed of sound in still air is 340 m/ s]",
        "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nFrequency of the horn, \u03bdH = 200 Hz\r\nVelocity of the man, vT = 20 m/ s\r\nVelocity of sound, v = 340 m/ s\r\n(a) We know,\r\n(i) The apparent frequency of the horn as the man approaches the observer is:\r\nv\u2019 = vH [ v/(v \u2013 vT) ]\r\n= 200 [ 340 /(340 \u2013 20) ]\r\n= 212.5 Hz.\r\n(ii) The apparent frequency of the horn as the man runs away from  the observer is:\r\nv\u2019\u2019 = vH [ v/(v + vT) ]\r\n= 200 [ 340 /(340 + 20) ]\r\n= 188.88 Hz.(b) The speed of sound is 340 m/s in both cases. The apparent change in frequency is a result of the relative motions of the observer and the source.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Take note of the given parameters: frequency of the horn (\u03bdH) is 200 Hz, velocity of the man (vT) is 20 m/s, and velocity of sound (v) is 340 m/s. These values are considered constants, given by the problem. Step 2) Understand the equation for the apparent frequency of the horn as the man approaches the observer: v' = vH [ v/(v \u2013 vT) ]. This equation is an application of the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of a wave changes due to the motion of the source. v' represents the frequency heard by the observer. Step 3) Substitute the constants into the equation: v' = 200 [ 340 /(340 \u2013 20) ]. This helps in calculating the apparent frequency when the source of the sound is moving toward the observer. After performing the calculation, we find that v' equals approximately 212.5 Hz. Step 4) Now, consider the case where the man is moving away from the observer. The equation that relates these parameters is: v'' = \u03bdH [ v/(v + vT) ]. This equation is similar to the one used in step 2, but there's a slight modification due to the change in relative motion between the observer and the source. Step 5) Substitute the constants into the equation: v'' = 200 [ 340 /(340 + 20) ]. This aids in calculating the apparent frequency when the source of the sound is moving away from the observer. Conducting the math, we find that v'' equals approximately 188.88 Hz. Step 6) Finally, it's important to note that in both cases, the speed of sound, v, remains 340 m/s. This is crucial because it signifies that the change in apparent frequency isn't a result of a change in the speed of sound, but rather due to the relative motions of the observer and the source of the sound.",

Step 5) Substitute the given parameters into this equation to find the apparent frequency when the man is moving away (approx. 188.88 Hz). Step 6) Remember that the speed of sound is constant (340 m/s) in both cases, indicating that the observed frequency change is due to relative motion between the observer and the source, not a change in the speed of sound."

        "Question": "Q29. A truck parked outside a petrol pump blows a horn of frequency 200 Hz in still air.  The wind then starts blowing towards the petrol pump at 20 m/s. Calculate the wavelength, speed, and frequency of the horn\u2019s sound for a man standing at the petrol pump. Is this situation completely identical to a situation when the observer moves towards the truck at 20 m/s and the air is still?",
        "Original Solution": "For the standing observer:\r\nFrequency, \u03bdH = 200 Hz\r\nVelocity of sound, v = 340 m/s\r\nSpeed of the wind, vW = 20 m/s\r\nThe observer will hear the horn at 200 Hz itself because there is no relative motion between the observer and the truck.\r\nGiven that the wind blows in the observer\u2019s direction at 20 m/s.\r\nEffective velocity of the sound, vE = 340 + 20 = 360 m/s\r\nThe wavelength ( \u03bb ) of the sound :\r\n\u03bb = vE /vH  = 360/200\r\n\u03bb = 1.8 m\r\nFor the observer running towards the train:\r\nSpeed of the observer, vo = 20 m/s\r\nWe know,\r\nThe apparent  frequency of the sound as the observers move towards the truck is:\r\nv\u2019 =   vH [(v + vo)/v ]\r\n=  200[ (20 + 340 )/ 340 ] =  211.764 Hz\r\nAs the air is still, the effective velocity of sound is still 340 m/s.\r\nAs the truck is stationary, the wavelength remains 1.8 m.\r\nThus, the two cases are not completely identical.",
        "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) To begin, identify the given information from the problem: the frequency of the horn (\u03bdH) is 200 Hz, the speed of sound in still air (v) is 340 m/s, and the speed of the wind (vW) is 20 m/s. Given these, we can understand that the wind is changing the conditions in which the sound wave is propagating. Step 2) Note that the frequency the observer hears (from the stationary truck) remains the same as the horn\u2019s original frequency due to no relative motion between the observer and the truck. This is in coherence with Doppler's effect. Step 3) With the wind blowing towards the observer, the effective speed of the sound changes. It is determined by adding the speed of sound in still air and the speed of the wind, i.e., vE = v + vW = 340 m/s + 20 m/s = 360 m/s. This altered speed is due to the movement of the medium (air). Step 4) To find the wavelength of the sound (\u03bb), we use the equation \u03bb = vE /\u03bdH , effectively dividing the effective velocity of sound by the sound\u2019s frequency. This gives us a wavelength of 1.8 m. Step 5) Now, consider the scenario where the observer runs towards the truck with a speed of 20 m/s. The frequency (\u03bd') the observer perceives in this case is different from before due to the movement of the observer, calculated using the Doppler's effect formula: \u03bd' = \u03bdH [ (v + vo) / v ], resulting in an apparent frequency of 211.764 Hz. Step 6) Given that there is no wind, the effective velocity of sound remains the unaltered at 340 m/s. And because the truck is stationary, the wavelength of the sound remains 1.8 m. Step 7) Upon comparing both cases, it is clear the circumstances are not identical. The frequencies experienced by the observer in two cases are different while the wavelengths remain the same.",
        "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values given by the problem: horn frequency (200 Hz), speed of sound in still air (340 m/s), and wind speed (20 m/s). Step 2) Since there's no relative motion between the observer and the stationary truck, the observer's perceived frequency remains the same as the horn\u2019s original frequency. Step 3) The wind's motion impacts the effective speed of the sound, calculated as vE = v + vW. Step 4) The wavelength (\u03bb) of the sound is determined with the equation \u03bb = vE /\u03bdH. Step 5) Contrarily, when the observer moves towards the stationary truck at 20 m/s in still air, they perceive a different frequency due to their motion, calculated using Doppler's Effect formula. The effective velocity of the sound remains the same, 340 m/s. Step 6) Despite the observer's motion, the wavelength of the sound remains 1.8 m because the truck is stationary. Step 7) Upon comparing these two scenarios, it becomes clear that the observer's experiences are not identical: while the wavelengths remain the same, the frequencies they perceive are different."
