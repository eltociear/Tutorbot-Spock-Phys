The question gives us four relationships between acceleration 'a' and displacement 'x'. We have to identify which of these are descriptions of simple harmonic motion (SHM). Do you know what conditions must be met for motion to be described as SHM?"

The proportionality constant is the square of the angular frequency of the oscillations. So, the equation should look like a = -\u03c9^2 * x. But I'm not sure how to apply this condition to the given options."

The standard equation for simple harmonic motion (SHM) can indeed be written as a = -\u03c9^2 * x where \u03c9^2 is the square of the angular frequency. For the given options, we could simplify our standard equation to a = -kx, where k = \u03c9^2 is a positive constant. By re-writing the equation in this form, it becomes easier to compare this with the given relationships. Let's proceed to the next step which is comparing our standard SHM equation 'a = -kx' with each equation provided in options (a), (b), (c), and (d). Let's start with option (a): a = 0.7x. Would this match our standard simplified equation of SHM?"
