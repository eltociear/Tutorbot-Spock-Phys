From the law of conservation of energy, the energy that the rocket lost due to the burning up and decrease in mass of its casing was transformed into the heat energy utilized for the burning process itself. That answers your question - the energy required for burning the casing is obtained from the rocket itself, not the atmosphere. Great job on applying the law of conservation of energy to solve this problem!"
