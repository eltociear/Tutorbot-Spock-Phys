In order to find the identity of the unknown gas, we need to use Graham\u2019s law of diffusion. This law states that there is an inverse relationship between the rates of diffusion of two gases and the square root of their molar masses. This can be represented by the formula R1 / R2 = (M2 / M1)^0.5. Are you familiar with this equation?"
