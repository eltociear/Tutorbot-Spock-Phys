In changing the state of a gas adiabatically from an equilibrium state A to another equilibrium state B, an amount of work equal to 22.3 J is done on the system. If the gas is taken from state A to B via a process in which the net heat absorbed by the system is 9.35 cal, how much is the net work done by the system in the latter case?

Let me convert that to Joules using the conversion 1 cal = 4.19 J. That would be 9.35 * 4.19 = 39.16 J. Then, we apply the first law of thermodynamics where the change in internal energy (\u0394U) equals the heat added to the system (\u0394Q) minus the work done by the system (\u0394W). But since the change in internal energy remains the same, I can calculate the work done by the system in the latter case would be \u0394U - \u0394Q which is -22.3 J - 39.16 J = -61.46 J. So, the work done by the system is -61.46 J in the process where the net heat is 9.35 cal. Does this seem right?"

Therefore, based on the values you computed, \u0394W should be calculated as 39.16 J (\u0394Q) - 22.3 J (\u0394U), not the other way around. Could you try again using these correct values?"
