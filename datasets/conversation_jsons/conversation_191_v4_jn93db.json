If the U-tube contains water, what is the difference in its levels in the two limbs of the tube? The surface tension of water at the temperature of the experiment is 7.3 \u00d7 10^(\u20132) N m^\u20131. Take the angle of contact to be zero and the density of water to be 1.0 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^(\u20133) (g = 9.8 m s^\u20132).\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."
