While the conservation of momentum does mean that the total momentum of a system must remain the same, it doesn't require that all components of the system move in the same direction. When the fluid moves out of the hole in the vessel, it gives a forward momentum. But because no external force is acting on the system, the conservation of momentum states that the vessel must gain an equal and opposite momentum, which results in a backward thrust on the vessel. Can you try to explain this in your own words?"

Because no external forces are acting on the system, when the fluid exits with forward momentum, the conservation of momentum demands that the vessel gains a backwards momentum. This is what's causing the backwards thrust on the vessel. The vessel isn't actually moving in the same direction as the fluid. It's the opposite."

The conservation of momentum results in the vessel experiencing a backward thrust as the fluid flows forward out of the vessel. Now, let's move onto the last part, part (e) about why a spinning cricket ball in the air does not follow a parabolic trajectory. The disruption to the trajectory is due to a principle known as the Magnus effect. Do you have any idea how this might work?"

Great work in understanding this concept and all other parts of the question!"
