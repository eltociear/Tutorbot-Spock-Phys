Bernoulli\u2019s equation is about fluid dynamics, specifically the conservation of energy for flowing fluids, and not about force, mass, and acceleration. It accounts for gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, and flow energy and is typically used for ideal liquids in a streamlined flow. Can you pass me this information again with the correct equation?"

Bernoulli's Equation is p + 1/2\u03c1v^2 + \u03c1gh = constant, where p is the pressure exerted by the fluid, v is the velocity of the fluid, \u03c1 is the fluid's density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height.

The equation is derived under the assumption of a non-turbulent or streamlined flow. Turbulence introduces energy losses due to friction and the mixing of different layers. So, in a scenario with a turbulent flow, such as a rapid in a river, can we still apply Bernoulli's equation effectively? Think about how turbulence might impact the conditions required for Bernoulli's equation."
