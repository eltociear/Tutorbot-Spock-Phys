As the temperature of a gas increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases causing more frequent and forceful collisions, leading to increased viscosity. Similarly, for liquids, as temperature increases, the molecules are able to slide past each other more easily, decreasing the viscosity. Hence, the words 'increases' and 'decreases' correctly fill the first and second blanks respectively. Now let's proceed to the next statement, statement (c). For solids with an elastic modulus of rigidity, the shearing force is proportional to \u2026, while for fluids, it is proportional to \u2026 What would you say are the correct terms to fill these blanks: 'shear strain' or 'rate of shear strain'?"

                "Tutorbot Response": "You're partly correct. In the case of fluids, the shearing force is indeed proportional to the rate of shear strain, representing how the deformation changes with time. However, for solids, the shearing force is proportional to the shear strain, indicating the deformation due to the applied force. The rate of change doesn't apply in the case of solids as it does for fluids. So, the correct words to fill in the blanks are 'shear strain' and 'rate of shear strain' respectively.

However, it also follows the Bernoulli\u2019s principle that states an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or decrease in the fluid's potential energy. So, the correct phrases to fill in the blank are 'conservation of mass' and 'Bernoulli\u2019s principle'. Now, let's move to the last statement, statement (e).

Turbulence at such a contained and small scale will occur at a greater speed in comparison to a full-scale, real-world scenario, because the model of a plane in a wind tunnel is much smaller and hence requires greater speed to replicate the same conditions as an actual plane. Thus, turbulence occurs at a greater speed for the model of a plane in a wind tunnel compared to an actual plane."

Regarding fluid physics principles, the change in fluid speed in a constriction area follows both conservation of mass and Bernoulli\u2019s principle. And finally, for a model of a plane in a wind tunnel, the turbulence will occur at higher speed compared to an actual plane. Let's confirm these answers: decreases, increases/decreases, shear strain/rate of shear strain, both 'conservation of mass' and 'Bernoulli\u2019s principle', and greater."
