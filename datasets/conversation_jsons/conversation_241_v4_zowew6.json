The problem gives us two main pieces of information: the stroke of the piston is 1.0 m, and it moves with an angular frequency (\u03c9) of 200 rad/min. A stroke is usually twice the amplitude of a harmonic motion for a piston. The angular frequency deals with the speed of the oscillation. Could you confirm if you understand this?"

            "value": "Student: Yes, I understand the given information. So I guess the next step would be to use the formula for maximum speed in simple harmonic motion, which is max speed = \u03c9A. But since the stroke is twice the amplitude, I think we need to halve the 1.0m to get the amplitude. That would give 0.5m as the amplitude, right? Then using the formula, the max speed would be 200 rad/min * 0.5m. But we have different units, how do we deal with that?"
