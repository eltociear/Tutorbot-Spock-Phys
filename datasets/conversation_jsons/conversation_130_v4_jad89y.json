Now, for part (b) of the question, I think kinetic energy is not conserved in the process because when the man brings his arms inwards, the system's moment of inertia decreases which also makes the total kinetic energy increase. This extra kinetic energy must come from the work the man has to do to bring his arms inwards. Is that correct?"
