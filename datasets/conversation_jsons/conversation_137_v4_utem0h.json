You have a good understanding of Kepler's third law and how it can be used to compare the orbits of different planets. As for your question about the planet's orbit being smaller despite moving faster, you're on the right track! Planets that are closer to the sun (smaller orbit) are 'pulled' harder by the sun's gravity, which causes them to move faster. Conversely, planets that are further away from the sun move slower. That's all according to Kepler's laws. Well done on successfully solving the problem!"
