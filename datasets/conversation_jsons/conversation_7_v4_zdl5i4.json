We have the area of the image of a house on a slide which is 1.75 cm2, and the area of the same image projected onto a screen which is 1.55 m2. The goal is to find the linear magnification. Do you understand what linear magnification means in this context?"

To find the linear magnification, we first find the area magnification by dividing the areas, then take the square root of the obtained number. In other words, the linear magnification is the square root of the area magnification. Let's go on and calculate the area magnification by taking the ratio of the area of the image on the screen to the area of the image on the slide. Insert those numbers in and let's see what you get."

Therefore, 1.75 cm2 would convert to 0.000175 m2. Using these values, the area magnification would be calculated as 1.55 m2 divided by 0.000175 m2, which equals around 8857. Can we proceed?"
