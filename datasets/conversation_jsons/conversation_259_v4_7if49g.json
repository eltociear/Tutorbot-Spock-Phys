The wave equation is y( x, t ) = 3 sin ( 36t +0.018x +\u03c0/4 ). In the phase, '36t +0.018x', the coefficients of both t and x are positive which means the wave is moving in the direction from right to left. This is because the direction of wave propagation is given by the change of phase with respect to position. For wave motion in the positive x direction, the equation would appear as a sin(wt - kx).  Conversely, for motion in the negative x direction, we would see a sin(wt + kx). Can you confirm this? "

For the frequency, we know the relationship between frequency (f), angular frequency (\u03c9), and time which is \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f, or I can rearrange as f = \u03c9/2\u03c0.
