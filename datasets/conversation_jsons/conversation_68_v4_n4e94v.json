However, their assumption that doubling the mass would halve the time is inaccurate. Based on the recalculation, the new acceleration 'a' is calculated to be -5.0 and the new stopping-time 't' is reduced to 3.0 seconds, instead of doubling to 12 seconds as the student supposed. This initiates a constructive conversation about how varying the inputs of a physics problem can yield very different outcomes.",

If we halve the mass to 10 kg, keeping all other variables the same, the acceleration 'a' actually doubles, becoming -5 ms^(-2). This increased deceleration actually causes the stopping time to be halved, not doubled, so 't' becomes 3 seconds. This shows us that in this context, a smaller mass means a larger acceleration (more slowing force per unit of mass), thus stopping the body quicker. So, physics isn't always as intuitive as we might expect, but it's always fascinating!"

So, if another body with the same initial speed and retarding force but half the mass were to race with our original body, the lighter body would stop first. However, if the initial velocities were different, we might have to use the formula v^2 = u^2 + 2as not forgetting to put negative sign on 'a' as how we did for 'F', right?"

If another object had a different initial velocity, we might need to adjust our equations accordingly and use v^2 = u^2 + 2as, indeed bearing in mind to keep the negative sign for 'a' as we did for 'F'. But always remember that physics is descriptive, not prescriptive. We have to adjust our approach based on the actual conditions of the problem. Well done on a great question that goes beyond the initial scope of the problem. Keep up the good work!"
