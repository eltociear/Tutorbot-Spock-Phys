This means that we're not setting any specific rules or parameters on how the object is moving. Our first step is to understand that we have five equations involving velocity (v), acceleration (a), displacement (r), time (t), and their average or initial values. The solution involves verifying each of these five relations, regardless of the specifics of the motion. Can you go through each of the relations and tell me if they hold true for all types of motion, and provide a brief explanation as to why or why not?"
