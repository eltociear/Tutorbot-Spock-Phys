The first step is to understand that the question asks about the force acting on a pebble during different stages of its upward and downward motion. We are given that the pebble has a mass of 0.05kg. Also, we know that the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 10 ms^(-2) which remains constant on Earth. Does that make sense so far?"

No matter if the pebble is moving upwards or downwards, the earth's gravity pulls it downward. Now, we will move onto the effect this force has on the pebble during its motion.

Then, at the highest point, the pebble is momentarily at rest, so the force of gravity is still applying a force downward but it has no effect on the direction of the pebble. During its downward motion, gravity accelerates the pebble until it hits the ground. If the pebble was thrown at an angle, the force would still be 0.5 N downwards. But I think the direction might change because the pebble would not just rise and fall in a straight path, it would follow a curved trajectory."

However, it's important to note that even when an object is thrown horizontally, gravity will still exert a force on it. It is gravity that pulls the object downwards while it also continues in its horizontal direction, which is why we see a parabolic trajectory in projectile motion. Thus, the net force will still be 0.5 N downwards, regardless of whether the pebble is thrown upwards, downwards, horizontally, or at an angle."

Therefore, even when the pebble is thrown in horizontally, gravity continues to act on it. The pebble will start to fall vertically while still moving horizontally, creating a curved path. Hence, the net force of 0.5 N still applies in the downward direction, regardless of the movement of the pebble. Can you think why the force remains the same?"
