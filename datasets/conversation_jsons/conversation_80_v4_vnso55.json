We're looking for the recoil speed of the gun. We've learned about Newton's third law and conservation of momentum in class. So, is it right to say that the momentum of the gun and shell before firing is zero, as they aren't moving? And after firing, their combined momentum should still equal zero?"

After firing, the sum of the momentum of the gun and the shell must still be zero to comply with the law of conservation of momentum. Now let's move on to the next step. We can formulate our equation based on this law. So, the equation of motion becomes 0 = m*v - M*V, where m is the mass of the shell, v is the speed of the shell, M is the mass of the gun, and V is the recoil speed of the gun.
