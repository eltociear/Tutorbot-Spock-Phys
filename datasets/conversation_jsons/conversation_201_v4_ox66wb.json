To answer your question, in the context of this problem, 'expand freely' means that there are no external forces or constraints preventing the expansion of the rods due to the increase in heat. Hence, they expand without creating any stress or tension at the junction. Ready to tackle a new problem, or is there anything else you'd like to know about this one?"
