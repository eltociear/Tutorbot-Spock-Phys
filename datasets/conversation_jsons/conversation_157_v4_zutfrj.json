The problem has given us some specific measurements for two wires, one made of steel and the other of copper. The given values are: length and cross-sectional area of the steel wire (l1 = 4.7 m and a1 = 3.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2) and those of the copper wire (l2 = 3.5 m and a2 = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2). It is also stated that both wires stretch by the same amount under a given load, so the change in length (\u0394l) for both is the same, and the applied force (F) is also the same for both. Can we confirm that we understand all these given variables?"

The length and cross-sectional area for both the steel and copper wires are given and are differ from each other, also it is mentioned both wires are under the same load, which means they both stretch by the same amount. So, we'll assume the change in length and the applied force is the same for both wires."

The lengths and cross-sectional areas of the wires, and the information that both wires stretch to the same length under the same force, are indeed key to the problem. Now that we've finished with the first step, let's move on to the second part. To find Young's modulus for each material, we need to use the formula for Young's modulus, which is Y = F/(a*l/ \u0394l). This formula shows the ratio of the stress applied to a material (the force per unit area, F/a) to the strain the material undergoes in response (the change in length divided by the original length, \u0394l/l). Can we proceed to this step?"

Now, we need to find the ratio of Young's modulus of steel to copper, so we should divide the Young's modulus of steel by that of copper: Ysteel/Ycopper = (F*l1/(a1*\u0394l)) / (F*l2/(a2*\u0394l)). Since F and \u0394l are the same for both and can be canceled out, Ysteel/Ycopper = (l1*a2) / (a1*l2)."

So the math should look something like this: Ysteel/Ycopper = 0.188 m\u00b2 / 0.105 m\u00b2 = 1.79. So, the ratio of Young's modulus of steel to that of copper is approximately 1.79."
