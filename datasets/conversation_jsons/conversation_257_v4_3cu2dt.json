The wavelength of a sound wave does indeed change when the medium through which the sound is traveling changes. Although the transmitted sound is the same, its speed and wavelength will change in different mediums while the frequency remains the same. This is due to the varying densities and elastic properties of different media. So in this case, while the frequency of the bat's ultrasonic sound remains consistent, the speed and consequently the wavelength of the sound will be different in air and water. It's why we had different values for the wavelength in air and water. I hope this clears up your doubt."
