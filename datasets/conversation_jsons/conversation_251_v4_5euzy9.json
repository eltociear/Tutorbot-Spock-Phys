It is pulled to a distance x0 and pushed towards the centre with a velocity v0 at time t = 0. Determine the amplitude of the resulting oscillations in terms of the parameters \u03c9, x0 and v0.

First, consider that the displacement of the spring can be represented by the equation x = a cos (\u03c9t+\u03b8), where a is the amplitude, the maximum distance the spring can move away from its equilibrium position. At time t = 0, the spring's displacement is x0 and its velocity is -v0. Can you display this information using the aforementioned equation?"
