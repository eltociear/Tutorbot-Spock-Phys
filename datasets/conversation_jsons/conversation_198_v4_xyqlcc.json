Then, when we add 27, gives T1 to be about -68.8\u00b0 C, not -931\u00b0 C. Careful with the arithmetic! It often helps to perform these calculations again to ensure accuracy.

The student attempted to calculate the temperature at which the wheel slips onto the shaft (T1) by doing the following calculations: T1 \u2013 27 = -0.01 / (10.44 \u00d710^(-5)), which results in the value -958 (according to the student). Then, the student added 27 to this value to get T1, resulting in -931 according to the student. We suspect this calculation to be incorrect, so we want to verify this using Python. We will conduct the calculation -0.01 / (10.44 \u00d710^(-5)) and add 27 to the result to get T1 and compare it with the student's answer of -931."
