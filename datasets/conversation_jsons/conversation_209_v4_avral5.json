When we say a body has high reflectivity, it means that it reflects a lot of the heat or light that it encounters, absorbing very little. Because the body isn't absorbing much, it doesn't have much to emit either. Remember, according to Kirchhoff's law, a body's ability to emit is directly tied to its ability to absorb.

However, it's not so much about the iron cooling more quickly in the open air, but rather the absorption of radiation. When you measure the temperature of a red-hot iron piece in the open, the surrounding atmosphere will absorb some of the radiation. This decreases the observed radiation intensity, resulting in a lower measured temperature. Conversely, when the same hot iron piece is in a furnace, the surrounding atmosphere's influence is minimal, and the pyrometer gives a correct reading.
