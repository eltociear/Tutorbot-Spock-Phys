We given that the acceleration due to gravity is (g = 9.8 m/s^2), the radius of an uncharged oil drop is (r = 2.0 x 10^-5 m), the density of the uncharged oil drop is (\u03c1 = 1.2 x 10^3 kg/m^3), and the viscosity of air is (\u03b7 = 1.8 x 10^-5 Pa s). We also need to note that we are assuming air buoyancy is negligible, treating the air's density as zero. This simplifies our calculations by taking out factors that would usually counteract the drop's downward motion. Are you following thus far?"
