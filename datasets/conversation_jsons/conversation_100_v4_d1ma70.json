Let's recall the law of conservation of linear momentum, which states that if no external forces act on a system, then the total linear momentum of the system remains constant, irrespective of the type of collision, be it elastic or inelastic. The concept of total energy which includes kinetic energy doesn't remain constant in an inelastic collision. The kinetic energy is partially lost in the form of heat, sound etc. Try again with this information in mind."

When the rocket burns its fuel and emits exhaust gases, it's effectively 'colliding' with those gas particles in a kind of inelastic collision. However, because those gas molecules are being expelled at high speeds in the opposite direction, the overall momentum of the rocket system (rocket + expelled gas) is still conserved. The rocket gains momentum in the upward direction and the gases gain momentum in the downward direction, thereby conserving the total momentum of the system."
