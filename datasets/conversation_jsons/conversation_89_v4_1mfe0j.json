When the coins are revolving with the disc, the frictional force exerted on them provides the centripetal force for their circular motion. This can be represented by the formula mv^2/r \u2264 \u03bcmg, where m is the mass of the coin, v is the speed, r is the radius, \u03bc is the friction coefficient, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Now, we want to substitute the value for v, as v = r\u03c9, into equation. This will simplify the equation to mr\u03c9^2/r \u2264 \u03bcmg. After further simplification, we get that r \u2264 \u03bcg/\u03c9^2. Can you perform these calculations and simplifications?"

If we then isolate r, we get r \u2264 \u03bcg/\u03c9^2. Substituting the values \u03bc=0.15 and \u03c9=3.52 rad/s into the equation, we get r \u2264 0.15*9.81/(3.52^2).
