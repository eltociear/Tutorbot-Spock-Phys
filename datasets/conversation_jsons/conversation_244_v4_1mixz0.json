Instead, we need to understand these accelerations as part of a single net or 'effective acceleration', which we denote as g'. This g' is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of these two individual accelerations. This is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, as these accelerations form a right-angle triangle. So, can you calculate the effective acceleration g' by using the formula g\u2019 = \u221a(g^2 + (v^4 / R^2))?"

The effective acceleration g' is indeed the square root of the sum of the square of gravitational and the square of centrifugal accelerations. Now, let's move to the next step. Using this effective acceleration, we can find the time period of the pendulum. The time period formula for a simple pendulum is t = 2\u03c0\u221al / g where l is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But considering the effective acceleration, we replace g with g'. So, can you express the formula for the time period using our calculated value for g'?"
