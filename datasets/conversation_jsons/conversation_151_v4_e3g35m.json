The reason we need the orbital velocity is because it's a crucial part of the total energy of the satellite when it's in orbit. You see, the total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (associated with motion, which depends on velocity) and potential energy (associated with the position, in this case, the height above Earth). As for your second question, to calculate the orbital velocity, v, we actually have a formula for that. The formula is v = sqrt(GMe / (Re + h)). This equation comes from the balance of forces acting on a satellite, where the gravitational force is equal to the force required for circular motion.
