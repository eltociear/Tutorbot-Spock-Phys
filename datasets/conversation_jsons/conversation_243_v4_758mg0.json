Answer the following questions :(a) Time period of a particle in SHM depends on the force constant k and mass m of the particle:T = = 2\u03c0 (\u221am/\u221ak)A simple pendulum executes SHM approximately. Why then is the time period of a pendulum independent of the mass of the pendulum?\n(b) The motion of a simple pendulum is approximately simple harmonic for small-angle oscillations. For larger angles of oscillation, a more involved analysis shows that T is greater than 2\u03c0(\u221al/\u221ag).

We are given a formula for the time period of a particle in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) which depends on the mass (m) and force constant (k). That's T =  2\u03c0 (\u221am/\u221ak).
