Firstly, we need to understand the three key variables in this problem: The rate at which heat is supplied (\u0394Q), the rate at which work is done (\u0394W), and the rate at which the internal energy changes (\u0394U). According to the law of conservation of energy, the heat supplied to the system (\u0394Q) should be equal to the work done by the system (\u0394W) plus the change in the internal energy of the system (\u0394U). In equation form, it becomes \u0394Q = \u0394W + \u0394U. Can you confirm if the understanding of the problem and the application of law of conservation of energy is clear?"
