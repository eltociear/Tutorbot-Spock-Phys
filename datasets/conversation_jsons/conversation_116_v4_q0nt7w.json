                "Description": "Verify the student's calculation of the distance the trolley moved while the boy was running. The student calculated this distance as the product of the final speed of the trolley (10.36 m/s) and the time it took for the boy to run the length of the trolley (5 seconds). Therefore, we need to compute 10.36 * 5 to confirm the student's answer of 51.8 meters."
