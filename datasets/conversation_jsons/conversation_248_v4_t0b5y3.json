We have a particle executing simple harmonic motion (SHM), and our task is to show that over a period of oscillation, the average kinetic energy (KE) is equal to the average potential energy (PE). This is a usual characteristic of simple harmonic motion. The mass of the particle is represented as 'm'. Can you explain what this scenario means?"

For a particle in SHM, its kinetic energy (KE) is given by KE = 1/2 m v^2, where m is mass and v is velocity. On the other hand, the potential energy (PE) is usually given by PE = 1/2 k x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. I think we will have to use both of these formulae to prove that the average KE equals the average PE over one period. But I'm not sure how the velocity 'v' and displacement 'x' are related."

Let's try again: 'Kav = (1/T) \u222b (1/2) m A\u00b2\u03c9\u00b2(1/2) dt from 0 to T' results in 'Kav = 1/4 m A\u00b2 \u03c9\u00b2'. I hope this clears the confusion.

Substitute the displacement 'x = A sin \u03c9t' into this expression, we get PE = 1/2 k (A sin \u03c9t)\u00b2 = 1/2 k A\u00b2 sin\u00b2 \u03c9t. Similarly to the kinetic energy, I guess we need to find the average of this over one period. We get PE_avg = (1/T) \u222bPE dt from 0 to T. Substituting the PE expression into this integral gives us PE_avg = (1/T) \u222b(1/2 k (A\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03c9t)) dt from 0 to T. Now, this looks similar to the last integral we did. So, if I apply the fact that the average value of sin\u00b2\u03c9t over one period is 1/2, the integral becomes easier. If I do this right, it should result in PE_avg =  1/4 k A\u00b2.
