Using the same concept, since the boy and the lift are moving together, I can assume the relative velocity of the boy with respect to the lift as the initial velocity. Hence, the initial velocity will be the speed the boy throws the ball at (49 m/s) plus the speed of the lift (5 m/s) making it a total of 54 m/s. Using the same equation, Vf = Vi + at, substituting the values, 0 = 54 m/s - 9.8 m/s\u00b2 * t. Calculating 't' will give us the time taken for the ball to return to his hands, again considering the ball makes a trip upwards and then comes down. I'll try to calculate this, whereas, I have a little doubt about how accurate this logic would be."

However, remember that as the ball is in the air, the lift continues to move upwards. Hence the ball has to travel an additional distance equivalent to the displacement of the lift to return to the boy's hands. Instead of the displacement being zero as in the previous case, the displacement (s) would now be equal to the distance the lift travels while waiting for the ball to return, which can be represented by 5t.

So, using the equation of motion, s = ut + 1/2gt\u00b2, where 's' is the displacement, 'u' is initial velocity, 'g' is the acceleration, and 't' is the time we should have 5t = 54t - 0.5*9.8*t\u00b2.
