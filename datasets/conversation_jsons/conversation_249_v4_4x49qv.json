We've been given the following values: I = 0.1125 kg.m^2 is the moment of inertia and T = 1.5 s is the period of torsional oscillation. The student calculated \u03b1 by substituting these values into the equation \u03b1 = 4\u03c0^2 * I / T^2 and got \u03b1 = 1.87 Nm/rad. We need to confirm this calculation."
