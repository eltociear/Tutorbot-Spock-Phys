The next step is to apply Hooke's Law, which is related to the principle of simple harmonic motion. According to Hooke's Law, the force experienced by a body is proportional to its displacement from its equilibrium position. This can be expressed as F=kx, where k is a constant and x is the displacement. Using your expression for F, can you solve for k?"
