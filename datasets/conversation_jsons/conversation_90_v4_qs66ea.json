Apart from gravity and the normal reaction force, there's also centrifugal force that's acting upwards on the motorcyclist when he's at the uppermost point of the sphere. The centrifugal force is caused by his forward motion and it tries to push him out of the loop, which opposes the force of gravity that's pulling him downwards. Can you try again to explain it, considering these forces?"

However, his forward momentum is creating a lifeward centrifugal force that opposes this downward gravity. As he moves along the surface of the uppermost part of the sphere, the surface is providing a downward reactionary force, which counterbalances the upward centrifugal force. This force balance prevents the motorcyclist from falling when he reaches the top of the sphere. Have I got that right?"

In normal conditions, gravity would pull things down towards the Earth, but here that is balanced by the counteractive forces of the normal reaction and the centrifugal force from the motorcyclist's movement. Well done! Now lets move on to the next step. We are going to use this understanding to figure out the minimum speed the cyclist must have to not fall at the top of the loop. According to a balance of forces, we can represent it as R + mg = mv^2/r, where R represents the normal reaction, m represents the mass of the motorcyclist, g is the acceleration due to gravity, v is the speed of the motorcyclist and r is the radius of the chamber. Can you tell me when would the motorcyclist just about make contact with the chamber but without any weight?"

So, we can equate R to zero in the equation and solve for the velocity v. Therefore, we modify the equation to 0 + mg = mv^2/r. Rearranging that, we get v=sqrt(r*g). Substituting values, r as 25m and g as 9.8m/s^2, we get v=sqrt(25*9.8) which gives us 49.5 m/s."
