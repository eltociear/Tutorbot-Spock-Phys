You are given the speed of the aircraft as 720 km/h, the angle of banking as 15\u00b0, and you need to find the radius of the horizontal loop the aircraft executes. For any object in a circular motion, the speed, radius, and gravitational force obey a certain relationship, which we will use to solve this problem. Can you tell me what this relationship is?"

So the force exerted at the time of this movement is equal to the product of the mass and the square of the velocity divided by the radius. The force F is also equivalent to m*g, where m is the mass and g is the gravitational pull, which is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. Thus, we can say m*v^2/r = m*g. In our case, though, the centripetal force is provided by the component of the gravitational force acting towards the centre of the loop, which gives us the relationship tan\u03b8 = v^2/(r*g). Is that correct?"
