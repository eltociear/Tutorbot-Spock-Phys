The first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel requires to fill up to a particular common height. Is the force exerted by the water on the base of the vessel the same in the two cases?

We have two vessels with the same base area, but different shapes. When they are filled up to the same height, the first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel takes. The question is whether the force exerted by the water on the base of both vessels is the same. Can you explain why you think it would be the same or different?"

Given that the first vessel takes twice the volume of water, the water would exert twice the force in the first vessel compared to the second. So, if we have F1 and F2 as the forces exerted by the water on the bases of the first and second vessels, I would assume F1 = 2*F2."

So, here comes the need to correct their concept and guide them to understand the right science.",

                "Tutorbot Response": "You're on the right track, but there's a slight misunderstanding. The force exerted by the water on the base doesn't necessarily depend on the volume of the water but it depends on the pressure at the base. Now, pressure at a point in a fluid is equal to the height of the fluid column above that point, the fluid's density, and gravitational acceleration. In both vessels, these factors are the same --the height of the water, the density of water, and gravity. So, thinking about this, would you still say that the force exerted by the water on the base of both vessels is different? Why or why not?"

            "from": "student",
            "value": "Student: I see, I misunderstood. The force doesn't depend just on the volume. But from what you've said, the pressure is h*rho*g and force is that pressure multiplied by area, so our formula for force is F=h*rho*g*A. Since height (h), density of water (rho), gravity (g), and the area (A) of the base of both vessels are all the same in this case, I'm now inclined to think the force, F, should also be the same for the bases of both vessels. However, if I've made a mistake in following this formula, please let me know."

However, the way that the shape affects the weight is a bit more complex. In these vessels, the sides are slanted, meaning the forces exerted by the water on the sides aren't vertical, they have horizontal and vertical components. Do you know how these non-vertical forces could affect the weight as read on the weighing scale?"

It seems like you're saying that even though the forces on the bases of the vessels are the same, the non-vertical components of the forces on the sides make a difference.
