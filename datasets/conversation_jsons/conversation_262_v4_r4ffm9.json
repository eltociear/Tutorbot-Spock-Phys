For our first step, we will start with understanding the characteristics of different types of waves. Stationary waves have \u03c9t and kx appearing separately, while in travelling waves, these terms combine as (kx \u2013 \u03c9t) or (kx + \u03c9t). If none of these characteristics are visible, the function does not describe either type of wave. Keep this in mind as you look at the first function y = 3 sin( 5x \u2013 0.5t ) + 4cos( 5x - 0.5t ). Can you identify the wave type for this function?"

In the case of our first function y = 3 sin( 5x \u2013 0.5t ) + 4cos( 5x - 0.5t ), kx - \u03c9t is present, which is characteristic of a travelling wave. Therefore, (i) should be a travelling wave.

Therefore, it doesn't describe either type of wave. Well done on reaching this conclusion!"
