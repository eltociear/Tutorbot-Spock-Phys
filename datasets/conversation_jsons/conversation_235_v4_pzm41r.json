Though the force does increase with displacement, it still remains proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the centre of motion, making it a case of simple harmonic motion, the characteristic being that the magnitude of the displacement affects the force.

However, these are not simple harmonic motion. The reason being that a polyatomic molecule has several natural frequencies. This means that the vibration is a combination(Superposition) of Simple Harmonic Motions with several different frequencies, thus making it not simple harmonic. So overall, you were correct in identifying it as periodic motion, but it is not simple harmonic motion."
