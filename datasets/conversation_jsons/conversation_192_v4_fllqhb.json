The correct calculation should be y = 8000 m * ln(1.25 kg/m^3 / 0.4467 kg/m^3), which indeed simplifies to y = 8000 m * ln(2.8). However, when calculated, this turns out to be approximately 8232 meters, not 16667 meters. Please try the calculation again, making sure to use a calculator for the natural logarithm and multiplication."

Re-calculating, the correct answer should indeed be y = 8000 m * ln(2.8) which equals to 8232 meters. I clearly made a mistake during the calculation. So, the zeppelin will rise to an approximate height of 8232 meters. Thank you for the correction!"
