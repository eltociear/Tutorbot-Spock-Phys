Here, your main task is to figure out the force exerted on the floor by the crew and passengers. We can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equivalent to mass times acceleration. But we must take into account both the influence of gravity and the helicopter's upward acceleration. Therefore, we'll use the equation R = m(g+a) where R is the total reaction force acted by the passengers and crew on the floor, m is their mass, g is the gravitational acceleration, and a is the upward acceleration. Now, can you give this a try by substituting m = 300 kg, g = 10 ms^-2, and a = 15 ms^-2 into this formula and calculate the value of R?"
