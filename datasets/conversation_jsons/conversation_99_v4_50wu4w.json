In this context, internal forces are the forces that the particles in the system exert on each other. In contrast, external forces are the forces that are applied to the system from the outside, not originating from the particles within the system. For example, if we consider a system of billiard balls, the impact when balls hit each other would be an internal force. If someone hits one of the balls with a cue, that would be an external force."

As a result, these forces cancel each other out, having no net impact on the total momentum of the system. That's why we can focus solely on the external forces when considering momentum change.\n"

In such a system, there are internal forces between the particles and external forces acting on the system from the outside. When we move on to the topic of momentum, we noted that the change in momentum of the system, or rate of change of momentum, is equals to the net external force on the system by applying Newton's second law, F = \u0394p/\u0394t. Importantly, we realized that internal forces do not affect the total momentum of the system because they balance out due to Newton's third law. Hence, any changes in the system's total momentum result solely from the net external forces acting on it."
