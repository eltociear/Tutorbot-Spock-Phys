However, this is a special case and not generally true for all rotations. In order for a physical quantity to be universally classified as a vector, it must always follow the laws of vector addition, not just in specific cases. So even though in this example the rotation seems to behave like a vector, rotation in general is still not classified as a vector. Does that make sense?"
