The value of '\u03b2' should be a lot less than what you've calculated. Let's try to correct that. You seem to have some confusion about the atan or arctangent function. Atan of a number x is the angle whose tangent is x. Also, remember when you're working with these functions in a calculator or a programming language like Python that the angle should be given in radians, not degrees. However, due to the properties of tan function, the result of arctan will be equivalent to your input multiplied by 180 divided by pi. Hence, the result of atan(18.08068954) would be considerably lower than 1036.629 degrees. Let's try this formula again: \u03b2 = atan((51*\u221a2/2)/(72+51*\u221a2/2))*180/pi.
