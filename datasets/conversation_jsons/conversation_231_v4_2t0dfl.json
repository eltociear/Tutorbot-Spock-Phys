The first term on the left side should represent the initial state of the system, and on the right side, the final state of the system. But the left term 76 isn\u2019t correct. The initial pressure is due to the 15 cm column of air (so we just need 15, not 76 + 15), and this is multiplied by its initial volume which is 15 cm as well. On the right side, the final volume isn't 100 - h cm, it's 24 + h cm (the initial length of the air column plus the amount of mercury displaced). Let's try again: set up your equation so that it represents P1V1 = P2V2 correctly, where P1 is the initial pressure (due to the 15 cm of air), V1 is the initial volume (also 15 cm), P2 is the final pressure (due to the h cm of mercury and the 24 cm of air column) and V2 is the final volume (24 + h cm)."
