The term \u03c11 / (1 - 3.67 \u00d7 10^-3) using \u03c11 = 1.03 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^-3 should give us \u03c12 = 1.068 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^-3 instead of 1.05 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^-3. Can you try recalculating \u03c12 using the values \u03c11 = 1.03 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^-3 and 3.67 \u00d7 10^-3 for the term (1 - \u03c11 / \u03c12)?"
