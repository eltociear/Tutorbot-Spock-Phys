Remember that the components of a vector are indeed projections onto each axis, but they still retain a directional characteristic - either positive or negative - depending on the direction of the component. Therefore, even though they represent magnitudes along certain directions, they are not scalars but remain to be vectors. Let's try the next statement."

The total path length refers to the 'distance covered' by a particle, taking into account every single twist and turn made by the particle.

So, the total path length is typically greater than the displacement except when the particle moves in a straight line. Let's move on to the fourth statement now."
