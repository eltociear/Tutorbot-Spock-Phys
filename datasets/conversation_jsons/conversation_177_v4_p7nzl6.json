The structure can withstand a maximum stress of 10^9 Pa. The depth of the ocean, where we are considering placing the structure, is 3 x 10^3 m. We also know the density of seawater is about 10^3 kg/m^3 and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2. Can you please confirm if you understand these given values and what they represent?"

From what I understand, 10^9 Pa is the maximum stress the structure can withstand, 3 x 10^3 m is the depth of the ocean, 10^3 kg/m^3 is the density of seawater and 9.8 m/s^2 is the acceleration due to gravity. I believe we can calculate the pressure at the given depth of ocean using the formula P = dgh, where P is the pressure we need to find, d is the density of seawater, g is the gravitational acceleration, and h is the depth of the ocean. Is that correct?"
