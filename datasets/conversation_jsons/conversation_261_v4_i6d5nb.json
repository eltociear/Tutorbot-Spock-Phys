The equation given is y (x, t) = 0.06sin(2\u03c0/3x)cos(120\u03c0t). This equation is of the form 2a sin(kx) cos(wt), which is the general equation for a stationary wave with a few modifications.

A wave travelling in the positive x direction is represented as y1 = a sin(wt - kx), while a wave going in the negative x direction can be represented as y2 = a sin(wt + kx). When we add these two waves, we get -2asin(kx)cos(wt). Can you identify with this?"

When we do that, it turns out that the resulting amplitude is 0.06. But let's continue with this in the next step.

With the frequency being 60 Hz, the wavelength 3 m, and the speed 180 m/s, you've accurately determined these key characteristics of each wave. Now, let's calculate the wire\u2019s tension. This involves the calculation of the mass per unit length (\u03bc) of the wire that is given by the mass of the wire (m) divided by the wire's length (l).
