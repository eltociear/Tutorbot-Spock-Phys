The escape speed of a body from Earth is determined by a specific mathematical equation, which includes the gravitational constant, the mass of the Earth, and the radius of the Earth. What do you notice about the parameters in this equation? Does the mass of the body, its location, or its direction appear in it?"

Now, moving on to the fourth factor, consider the height from where the object is launched. Would that affect the escape speed? Why do you think so?"

The higher the launching point over the Earth's surface, the greater the radius becomes. Therefore, assuming all else stays constant, a greater launching height would lead to a lower escape speed. Am I correct in my thinking?"
