Instead, it gives us the expression for the force due to displacement of the height in both arms of the U-tube. By relating this force to F = -kx, we can see that 'k' in this case is equivalent to 2A\u03c1g. Essentially, we're saying that the rate at which the force changes with respect to displacement (which is what 'k' represents) is equal to 2A\u03c1g in this system. The term -\u03c1gh isn't the acceleration, but part of the force expression.
