About F=ma and E=mc^2, these are different formulas used in physics. For energy, we use a dimensional formula which is M L^2 T^-2. This formula comes from the general understanding that energy is equivalent to the product of mass, the square of length divided by the square of time. Do you follow me? Now using the values given for \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, can you apply this formula to derive the new unit for a calorie?"

So the energy E equals to \u03b1 kg (\u03b2 m)^2/(\u03b3 s)^2. However, it seems like the numerator and denominator don't balance, because kg is not equal to m^2/s^2.

Each unit plays a unique role in defining the energy. For example, kg measures the mass of something, m^2 measures distance travelled in two dimensions, and s^-2 measures duration. Now, consider the energy, which is equivalent to the product of mass (in kg), the square of length (in m) and the inverse square of time (in s). In your case, mass is \u03b1 kg, length is \u03b2 m, and time is \u03b3 s. Can you try to substitute these values in the equation again?"

If a Calorie equals 4.2 Joules, then we can substitute 4.2 J into the equation to find the new unit for a Calorie. So, a Calorie equals 4.2 (\u03b1 kg)*(\u03b2 m)^2/(\u03bd s)^2. However, we want the representation to be in terms of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 only. Therefore, we need to get rid of the kg, m, and s in the equation. We can do that by dividing each term by the corresponding unit. After that we get: a Calorie = 4.2 \u03b1^\u20131 \u03b2^\u20132 \u03b3^2. Wait, isn't this the value we were supposed to get?"
