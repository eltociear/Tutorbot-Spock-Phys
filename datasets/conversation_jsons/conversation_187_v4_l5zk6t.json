We analyze the problem and see that the diameter of the artery is given as 2 \u00d7 10^\u20133 m, and we are asked to determine the largest average velocity of blood flow that would still sustain a laminar flow in the artery. Based on this, can you make any connections between the maximum average velocity of blood flow and the diameter of the artery?"

But I think we use the equation Re = \u03c1vd/\u03bc, where Re is Reynolds number, \u03c1 is density of blood, v is velocity, d is diameter of artery, and \u03bc is viscosity of blood. However, if we have a turbulent flow, Re would be greater than 2000. Given that we need to make the flow laminar, should we set Re equal to 2000 and solve for v?"

In this case, our problem is suggesting a relationship exist between the diameter of an artery and the maximum average velocity of blood flow for it to remain laminar. This relationship can indeed be analyzed using Reynolds number as you correctly mentioned. Since we want to avoid turbulent flow, we could set Re equal to the critical value of 2000, which denotes the beginning of turbulence, and solve for v, the maximum average velocity that would still allow laminar flow. Now, let's proceed with the next step: Can you explain what happens when the velocity of the blood flow increases in relation to the laminary flow?"

This could cause the flow to transition from smooth laminar to a turbulent state. Can we agree on this?"

But, keep in mind that Bernoulli's principle assumes an ideal fluid with no viscous forces. However, in real conditions like the flow of blood in an artery, viscous forces (dissipative forces) do play an important role. As the velocity of the fluid (blood in this case) increases, these dissipative forces also increase, causing a resistance against the smooth, laminar flow. If the velocity increases significantly, it could cause the flow to become turbulent. So, while Bernoulli's equation is very useful, it doesn't fully capture what occurs in a real-life situation like this one. Does that make sense?"

If we apply Bernoulli's equation here, as the velocity of the blood increases, the pressure reduces. Therefore, the decrease in pressure would counteract any increase in velocity, maintaining a laminar flow regardless of the velocity. Is this not the case?"

Unfortunately, that's not the full story in our case. In reality, when dealing with real fluid such as blood in an artery, there are other factors to consider beyond velocity and pressure. As the velocity of fluid increases, the dissipative forces, related to viscosity in the fluid, also increase. When these forces increase sufficiently, they can disrupt the smooth, streamlined flow causing it to transition to a turbulent state, even if according to Bernoulli's equation the pressure is decreasing. So, while Bernoulli's equation is very insightful, it doesn't fully capture all the complex interactions happening especially at higher velocities for a viscous fluid like blood."

So while velocity impacts pressure as per Bernoulli's equation, we also need to consider the dissipative forces that can lead to turbulence at higher velocities. But just one point though, if I'd like to factor in these forces in the equation, would I use the Stokes' Law, F = 6\u03c0\u03b7rv, since it accounts for the drag force on a small sphere moving through a viscous fluid?"

Keep in mind, though, that Stokes' Law is particularly applicable for small particles moving in a viscous medium \u2013 it's not exactly the same scenario as our blood flow in arteries. Nonetheless, this law helps us see how viscous forces can influence a fluid's motion. With this understanding, we can now proceed to the next step, where we discuss what happens when the fluid velocity further increases. Considering our conversation, do you think the dissipative forces would change in importance as the fluid velocity increases, and why?"
