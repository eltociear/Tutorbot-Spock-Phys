Now, let's go to the final step, Step 6. It's important to note that in both cases, the speed of sound, v, remains 340 m/s. This is crucial because it signifies that the change in apparent frequency isn't a result of a change in the speed of sound, but rather due to the relative motions of the observer and the source of the sound.
