Even though the direction of the vectors might differ, we can definitely compare their magnitudes without considering their direction.

Statement (b) is true because it's specifically only comparing the magnitudes, not the directions. Let's examine statement (c): 'The magnitude of l can never be greater than the sum of the magnitudes of m, n and o'. For this, I remember there's a triangle inequality in vector math, which states the magnitude of the sum of two vectors is always less than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the two vectors. Using that, we can say the magnitude of l is always less than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of m, n and o. So, statement (c) is true."

If l and o are collinear, it means they lie on the same line. I think then m + n should also lie on the same line and not just any line of l and o.

When vectors l and o are not collinear, they indeed form a plane, and any vector formed from them, which includes the sum of vectors m and n, will lie in this plane. Likewise, when vectors l and o are collinear, they lie on the same line, and the sum of m and n will also fall on this same line. Therefore, both parts of the statement (d) are true. Great job working through these vector-based statements. Do you have other questions on this topic or any other topic?"
