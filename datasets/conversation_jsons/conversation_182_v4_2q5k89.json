The correct pressure difference, p', should be about 9.8 x 10^2 Pa. Now, let's move on to the next step. We'll use the Reynolds number to check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number is calculated using the formula R = (4 \u03c1 V)/(\u03c0 d \u03b7). If the Reynolds number is less than 2000, the flow is typically considered laminar. Can you calculate the Reynolds number using the given formula and data?"
