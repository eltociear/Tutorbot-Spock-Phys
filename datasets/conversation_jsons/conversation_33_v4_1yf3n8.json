Let's begin with the first statement: 'A particle in one-dimensional motion with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant.'

Now, let's move to the second statement: 'A particle with zero speed may have non-zero velocity.'

Suppose the car is moving to the left (considered as the negative direction), and you apply the brakes. The acceleration (braking) is acting to the right (considered as the positive direction). So, even though you have positive acceleration, the car is slowing down. Therefore, the statement 'A particle with a positive value of acceleration must be speeding up' is not always true.

However, it's critical to remember in this particular context we are considering a one-dimensional motion scenario where we've assigned positive and negative directions. If motion is in the positive direction, then positive acceleration indeed means speeding up. However, if motion is in the negative direction, a positive acceleration actually opposes the direction of the motion, thereby slowing the particle down. It's just another way of viewing the situation. In this scenario, the term 'positive' is more about the direction we've assigned rather than suggesting an increase in speed."
