In this problem, there are two types of kinetic energy we need to consider, rotational and translational, because the hoop is already in motion. Do you understand why we need to account for both types of kinetic energy in this problem?"

The hoop's rotation is about its center, which is moving translationally. I think we can use the formulas that the translational kinetic energy is given by 0.5*m*v^2 and the rotational kinetic energy by 0.5*k*m*r^2, where k is the rotational inertia for the hoop, m is the mass, v is the velocity, and r is the radius.

The moment of inertia 'I' of a hoop about its own center is given directly by 'I = mr^2'. With this in mind let's move to step 2. We're given that the radius of the hoop 'r' is 2 m, the mass of the hoop 'm' is 100 kg, and the speed at the hoop's center of mass 'v' is 20 cm/s. But remember that we need to convert cm/s into m/s for our calculations, so v is 0.2 m/s in SI units. Please confirm that you have understood this."

Remember, the total energy ET of the hoop is the sum of its rotational kinetic energy and translational kinetic energy, so ET = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2)I\u03c9^2. 'I' is the moment of inertia, and '\u03c9' is the angular velocity. Think about how you can use the given variables and the moment of inertia formula 'I = mr^2' in this energy equation."

However, the equation can be further simplified. Can you spot that both of these components of energy can be written as equal expressions?"

Good job on understanding this concept! Now, let's proceed to the next step where we equate the total energy to the work done to stop the hoop.
