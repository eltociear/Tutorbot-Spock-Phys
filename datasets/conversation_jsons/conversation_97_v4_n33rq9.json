Let's consider the example of gravity. As an object is raised away from the Earth (increased separation), its potential energy increases, and as it falls closer to the Earth (decreased separation), its potential energy decreases. So, when positive work is done by a conservative force (like gravity) and the body moves towards the source of the force, what happens to the potential energy?"
