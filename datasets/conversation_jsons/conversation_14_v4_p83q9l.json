For the distant objects, the change in the angle of line of sight is quite small, that's why they appear stationary or seem to move along with us."

You correctly stated that the rapid change in your line of sight for nearby objects makes them seem to move quickly, whereas the slow change for distant objects makes them seem stationary or moving with us. Now, let's put this concept into motion. Can you try to visualize and describe this motion in Step 3? Consider how your train, your moving eyes, and the outside stationary objects are part of different frames of reference."

This is our frame of reference, the train. Now, let's consider a tree nearby. Since the tree is closer to us and not moving, it appears to be moving quickly in the opposite direction to the train's motion, that is to the left.\n\nAs for the distant objects, since they are far away, the change in the line of sight as the train moves right is pretty small. This small change means these objects seem to be stationary or maybe slightly moving to the right, the same direction the train is moving. This is because our eyes, and hence our frame of reference is moving towards the right. \n\nAlso, the rate at which nearby objects seem to move compared to the distant objects is called motion parallax. This explains why we perceive different speeds of objects at different distances when viewed from a moving platform like a train.\n\nDid I get this correct?"

This indeed explains why we perceive different speeds for the objects at varying distances from us. Now, the last part is about the relation between the line of sight and the distance from the objects. Given your understanding, could you try and explain Step 4 for me? How does the line of sight for distant objects change as compared to nearby objects, and why does that make distant objects appear stationary?"

            "value": "Sure, let's see. The line of sight for distant objects changes less dramatically as compared to that of nearby objects. If we assume parallel lines of sight, the angle stays relatively constant despite the movement of the train. This is due to the significant distance from the observer. \n\nHowever, in reality, because our eyes move, the lines of sight are not exactly parallel but they diverge slightly according to the distance. But even with this divergence, the change in the angle of our line of sight for the distant objects is negligible given the great distance they are from us. The small change is hard to perceive with our eyes, so distant objects appear to be stationary. Did I get it right this time?"

The small change in the line of sight angle due to the large distance to the object gives us the illusion that distant objects are stationary or moving with us. You've now fully understood this common observation. Great work!"
