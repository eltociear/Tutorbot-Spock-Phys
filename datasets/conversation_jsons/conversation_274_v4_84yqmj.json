Thus, knowing the bat's speed as a fraction of the speed of sound is enough for this problem. Now, let's move to step 3 of our problem where we start calculating the Doppler effect."

I think I remember the formula for the Doppler effect when the source is moving towards the observer, it's f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs). So, if we substitute in our values, we get f' = 40 kHz * (1 + 0.03) / (1 - 0). That should give us the frequency the bat hears, correct?"
