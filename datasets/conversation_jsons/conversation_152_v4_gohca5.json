However, there's a misinterpretation of how the energies relate. Before the collision, the total energy of the system is indeed the sum of the initial potential energy and the kinetic energy. But remember, at this point their speeds are negligible, so the kinetic energy component is essentially zero. After the stars collide, their velocity is not negligible and kinetic energy comes into play. Meanwhile, the potential energy changes because the distance between the stars changes. So, after the collision, the total energy is the sum of the final kinetic and potential energy. That's why in Step 5, the total energy formula is E = Mv^2 - GMm/2R, not E = -GMm/r + Mv^2. The final kinetic energy Mv^2 is based on their speed at collision, while -GMm/2R represents the final potential energy when the two stars are as close as they can be.

Now, I can solve this equation for v to find the speed with which the stars collide.
