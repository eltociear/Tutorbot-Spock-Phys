When pulling a lawnmower, the vertical component of the force applied generally reduces the effective weight of the mower. On the other hand, while pushing, the vertical component of the force tends to increase the effective weight of the mower. As a result, it is easier to pull than to push.

It's about reducing the impact of catch, but more precisely, it's related to the physics principle that force is inversely proportional to time taken (F = m*deltaV/deltaT). When the cricketer moves their hands backwards, it increases the time of contact with the ball, which in turn, decreases the force experienced. This means the cricketer can smoothly catch the ball without much stinging effect. Can you now explain the overall concept again with this in mind?"

First, a horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space because there's no ground to exert the opposite force needed for the horse to push against and move, according to Newton's third law of motion. Second, when a speeding bus stops suddenly, passengers are thrown forwards due to their inertia of motion. Their upper body still has the tendency to move forward while their lower bodies have been forced to stop with the bus. Third, pulling a lawnmower is easier because the vertical component of the force reduces the effective weight of the mower, as compared to pushing where the vertical component increases the effective weight. Last, a cricketer moves his hands backwards while catching a ball to increase the time of contact which decreases the force experienced by his hands. This is explained by the formula that force is inversely proportional to time taken. I guess this means the cricketer minimize the impact felt upon catching."
