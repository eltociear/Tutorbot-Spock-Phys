                "Description": "Verify the student's calculation for the change in kinetic energy. The student calculated the change in kinetic energy as 634.05 Joules, by subtracting the initial kinetic energy from the final kinetic energy. In this case, the initial kinetic energy is 0 Joules and the final kinetic energy is 634.05 Joules. So, the change in kinetic energy should be 634.05 Joules - 0 Joules."
