We are given that a body is initially at rest and it undergoes one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration. The power delivered to it at time 't' is proportional to certain forms of 't'. Our goal is to establish the relation between power and time. Can you tell me the equation for force according to Newton's second law of motion? It's the starting point to solve this problem."

Based on calculus, we know acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, represented as a = dv/dt. Since acceleration is constant as stated, this means the rate of change of velocity with time or dv/dt is also constant. Can you tell me what the implication of dv/dt being constant is for the change in velocity?"

However, I would suggest using a different symbol for the constant to avoid confusion, as 'a' is already being used to represent acceleration. So instead of v = at, we would express this as v = \u03b1t where \u03b1 is a new constant. Now, let's move on to the next step. Can you recall the equation that we use to express the relationship between a small change in velocity dv and a small change in time dt? We previously referred to it."

Given the equations we've discussed, can you substitute F with ma and v with \u03b1t, and tell me what we find for power?"

From Newton's second law, we know that force F = ma, and from the relation we derived earlier, velocity v = \u03b1t. So, when you substitute these into the equation for power, P = F.v, you get P = (ma)(\u03b1t), which can be simplified to P = ma.\u03b1t. The thing to understand here is that both 'ma' and '\u03b1t' are basically representing a type of velocity at time 't'. Therefore, this can tell us about the dependence of power on time. What do you think P is proportional to, considering this expression?"
