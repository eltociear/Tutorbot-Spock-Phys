We want to find the average thermal energy of a helium atom in three different temperatures: room temperature (27 C), at the surface temperature of the Sun (6000 K), and in the core of a star (10^7 K). You'd agree on this, right?"

The theorem says that the average energy of an atom is given by (3/2) kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. However, it's important to note that the temperature given for the first part is in Celsius, so we'll need to convert it into Kelvin before proceeding with the calculation. Also, should we take into account the number of particles or degrees of freedom for helium here?"
