Vectors are quantities defined by both direction and magnitude, not by their position.

Except for position vectors, which represent a specific position from an origin, vectors generally do not have a fixed location. Can you rephrase your understanding based on this?"

While it's true that two vectors with the same magnitude and direction can seem similar, their physical effects can be different depending on their location in space. Consider the example of two forces acting on a body at two different points. Even though these forces are identical, they won't produce the same rotation if the body rotates around an axis. Their physical effect - in this case, the rotation they cause - depends on their distance from the axis of rotation. Can you think of this situation and try to expand on your previous understanding?"

Based on that, if two identical forces are exerted at two different points on a seesaw, one closer to the center and one further away, the seesaw will tilt towards the side with the force further from the center due to higher torque."
