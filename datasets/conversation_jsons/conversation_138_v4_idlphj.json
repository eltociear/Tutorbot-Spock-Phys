The equation we're working with is: MS/MJ = (RE/RI0)\u00b3 * (TI0/TE)\u00b2, and the values are RE = 1.5 x 10^11 m, RI0 = 4.22 x 10^8 m, TE = 31,536,000s, and TI0 = 152,821s. Let me retry the calculation: MS/MJ = (1.5x10^11 / 4.22x10^8)^3 * (152,821 / 31,536,000)^2, which simplifies to approximately 0.001, or 1/1000. Therefore, the mass of the Sun is 1000 times the mass of Jupiter. Thanks for your help!"
