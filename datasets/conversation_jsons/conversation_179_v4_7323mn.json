As stated in the problem, the mercury levels are same on both ends. So, we can say that the pressures at the points (we denoted them as A and B) where spirit and water intersect with mercury are also equal. Therefore, we can write an equation relating the pressure at the two points: P0 + \u03c11h1g = P0 + \u03c12h2g, where \u03c11 and \u03c12 are densities of spirit and water respectively.

That's why we can equate the two pressures, P0 + \u03c11h1g and P0 + \u03c12h2g and therefore write the equation. But shouldn't we calculate the density of the spirit and the water instead of just using \u03c11 and \u03c12? Because those variables represent the density of the spirit and the water, right?"

However, recall that specific gravity is a comparison of the densities, meaning we don't need the actual density values but the ratio of these densities. Therefore, we can proceed with solving the problem using the known values and physical relations. Given the equation we have deduced, we can eliminate P0 from both sides because it is constant.

Now, the density of water (\u03c12) is a known constant, and from the problem, you have the heights h1 and h2. Now moving to the next step, notice that the specific gravity we are looking for is actually the ratio \u03c11/\u03c12. What can you infer about the ratio h2/h1 based on our current equation?"
