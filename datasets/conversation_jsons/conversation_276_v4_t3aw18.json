            "value": "No, these two scenarios would not be considered identical. Even though the speed of sound ends up being the same in both cases at 340 m/s, the outcomes for frequency and wavelength are different. In the first scenario, the frequency stays the same at 200 Hz, and the wavelength is 1.8 meters, while in the second scenario, the frequency increases to about 211.76 Hz, and the wavelength reduces to about 1.6 meters due to the man moving towards the truck. So, the frequencies and wavelengths that the man perceives differ in the two situations."
