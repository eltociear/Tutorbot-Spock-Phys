We are told that two absolute scales, A and B, both define the triple points of water at different scales: 200 A and 350 B, respectively. The term 'triple points of water' refers to a unique temperature that allows ice, water, and steam to coexist. On any temperature scale, this is a specific measure and serves as a useful point for temperature conversions. Have you understood this concept?"
