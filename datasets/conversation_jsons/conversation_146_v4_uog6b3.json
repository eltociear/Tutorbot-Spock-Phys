You're correct, we use Kepler\u2019s third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the period of any planet about the Sun is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Let's use this fact for our advantage. Now, let's move on to Step 3. In this equation from Kepler\u2019s law, %(gravitational constant)G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Sun, and the 4\u03c0^2 is a constant derived from the mathematics of a planet\u2019s orbit.
