From the relationship we've derived, we find '\u03b12 / \u03b11  =  MR^2 / ((2/5)*MR^2)' = 5/2.

The moment of inertia of the solid sphere, I2, is less than the hollow cylinder, I1, because the cylinder's distribution of mass far from the axel is greater than the sphere's. So, when equal torques are applied, the sphere, having a lesser moment of inertia, will have a larger angular acceleration. As angular acceleration and angular speed are directly proportional, the sphere would have a greater angular speed after a given time."

As we have established, for equal initial angular velocities and the same time, the final angular velocity directly correlates with the angular acceleration, meaning \u03c9 \u221d \u03b1.
