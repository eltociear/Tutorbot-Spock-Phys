The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth\u2019s two locations six months apart in its orbit around the Sun. That is, the baseline is about the diameter of the Earth\u2019s orbit \u2248 3 \u00d7 1011m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that with such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1\u201d (second) of arc or so. A parsec is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale. It is the distance of an object that will show a parallax of 1\u201d (second of arc) from opposite ends of a baseline equal to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. How much is a parsec in terms of metres?\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."
