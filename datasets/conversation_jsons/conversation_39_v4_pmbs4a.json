The first step in solving this problem requires us to understand the difference between scalar and vector quantities. A scalar quantity is defined by its magnitude alone, whereas a vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. Now, taking this into account, can you categorize each of the physical quantities provided as either scalar or vector?"
