What is wrong with taking the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water as standard fixed points (as was originally done in the Celsius scale)?\n(b) There were two fixed points in the original Celsius scale, as mentioned above, which were assigned the numbers 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, respectively. On the absolute scale, one of the fixed points is the triple-point of water, which on the Kelvin absolute scale is assigned the number 273.16 K. What is the other fixed point on this (Kelvin) scale?\n(c) The absolute temperature (Kelvin scale) T is related to the temperature tc on the Celsius scale by tc = T \u2013 273.15. Why do we have 273.15 in this relation and not 273.16?\n(d) What is the temperature of the triple-point of water on an absolute scale whose unit interval size is equal to that of the Fahrenheit scale?\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

The formula for that could be: F = (K \u2013 273.15) x 9/5 + 32, so I'd plug in 273.16 K into that formula. Let's calculate: F = (273.16 - 273.15) x 9/5 + 32 = 32.018 \u00b0F. However, because the absolute temperature scale that we're converting to uses intervals the same size as Fahrenheit but begins at absolute zero like Kelvin, we might need to subtract 32 from our result to get the equivalent temperature to Fahrenheit. So, the final answer would be 0.018 \u00b0F."
