Therefore, their answer is approximately correct and can be approved. As the student has successfully finished the last step of the solution, the problem can be marked as finished.",

                "Tutorbot Response": "That's correct! The loss in the kinetic energy \u0394KE does indeed equal to [1/2 * I1 * \u03c91^2 + 1/2 * I2 * \u03c92^2] - [(I1*\u03c91 + I2*\u03c92)^2 / (2*(I1+I2))]. Your execution of the final calculations is excellent. With that, you have successfully completed all steps and solved the problem. Well done!"
