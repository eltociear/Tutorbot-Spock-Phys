The energy required to overcome Mars' gravitational pull should be calculated using the formula - Gmm/ms/r, which translates to -6.67\u00d710^-11 N m^2 kg^\u20132 * 6.4\u00d710^23 kg * 1000 kg / (3.395 \u00d710^6 m). That gives us about -1.88\u00d710^10 Joules. The negative sign indicates that work must be done to overcome the potential energy so, the energy required will be 1.88\u00d710^10 Joules. The total energy then required to launch the spaceship out of the solar system from Mars will be the energy required to overcome the Sun's gravitational pull, 5.846\u00d710^11 Joules, plus this value of 1.88\u00d710^10 Joules. However, when I add these together, I obtain a total of 6.034\u00d710^11 Joules. I must have made a mistake in my calculations."
