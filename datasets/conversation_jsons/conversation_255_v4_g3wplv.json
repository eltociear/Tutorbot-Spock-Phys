Water vapor has a lower molecular mass than the dry air molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen. As a result, humidity leads to a lower average molecular mass M of the air. From our equation v = sqrt(\u03b3RT/M), since 'M' is in the denominator, a decrease in 'M' would cause an increase in 'v', which is the speed of sound. Therefore, speed of sound increases with an increase in humidity."

With increased humidity, the overall air density decreases because water molecules have a lower density than dry air molecules.
