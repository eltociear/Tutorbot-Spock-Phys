From the problem, we are given that a steel tape of length 1m is correctly calibrated at a temperature of 27.0 C. It's important to remember that the length of objects can expand or shrink depending on the temperature, due to the property of thermal expansion. In this case, we are expressed the length in cm for ease of computation, so 1m becomes 100 cm. Now, can you tell me why we need to convert the length from meter to centimeter in this context?"

The problem states that the length of a steel rod as measured by the tape on a hot day (temperature = 45.0 C) is 63.0 cm.

Despite being made of the same material, thermal expansion could still affect our ability to properly measure the steel rod's length.
