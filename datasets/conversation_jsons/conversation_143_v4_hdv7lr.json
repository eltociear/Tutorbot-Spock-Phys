The increased blood supply to the head can put extra pressure on the brain and could potentially result in a headache. So, the possibility of astronauts experiencing headaches in space cannot be completely discarded. Let's move on to the final symptom - orientation problems. Considering there's no defined 'up' or 'down' direction in space, could that pose a problem for astronauts?"
