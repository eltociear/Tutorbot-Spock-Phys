We have to define the problem in terms of potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom. We take into account the energy created by both translation and rotation. Can you define the problem parameters and declare the variables? For instance, let's let the mass of the sphere be 'm', the height of the incline be 'h', and the eventual velocity of the sphere at the bottom of the plane be 'v'."
