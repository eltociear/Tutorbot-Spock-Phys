But for (ii) the length of a wire bent into a loop, vectors can be applied to represent the forces acting on the loop like the tension or the magnetic field. And for (iii) a plane area, vectors can be associated with the area to represent quantities like the force applied in a particular direction, is that correct?"

However, you're slightly off for the length of a wire bent into a loop, and your understanding of the vector association to a plane area. The length is a scalar quantity and has no direction, hence, it cannot be associated with a vector. For a plane area, the vector in question is the surface vector, which is perpendicular to the plane area and whose magnitude is equal to the area itself. Try to think it over again."

So for a wire loop, even though we can consider forces acting on it, we can't really say a length is associated with a vector, and for a plane area, it's the surface vector that's associated with it.
