Firstly, the problem asks for the components of angular momentum along the x, y, and z axes. As you may know, angular momentum is obtained by taking the cross product between the position vector and the momentum. Here we have the position vector r = x\u00ee + y\u0135 + zk\u0302 and the momentum vector p = px\u00ee + py\u0135 + pk\u0302. Can you tell me how to find the angular momentum using these vectors?"

Can you do this for each unit vector - \u00ee, \u0135, and k\u0302?"

If we cross out the row and column containing \u00ee, we're left with this 2x2 matrix:\n\n|  y  z  |\n|  py pz |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix will be (y*pz - z*py). Then we do the same for \u0135 (y-component), giving us:\n\n|  x  z  |\n|  px pz |\n\nThe determinant here will be (x*pz - z*px). Finally, for k\u0302 (z-component), we get:\n\n|  x  y  |\n|  px py |\n\nThe determinant in this case is (x*py - y*px). So l = (y*pz - z*py)\u00ee - (x*pz - z*px)\u0135 + (x*py - y*px)k\u0302.

Now let's move on to the next part where the problem indicates the particle only moves in the x-y plane. This implies there is no movement in the z direction, hence z and pz = 0.
