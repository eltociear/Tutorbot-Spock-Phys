We are given four different formulas for the displacement of a particle. Each of these formulas involves a variable y for displacement, a variable a, and the sinusoidal function applied to a certain argument. Our aim is to check whether each formula is dimensionally correct. Dimensions are like units but more abstract (like length, time, mass), and when we talk about an equation being 'dimensionally correct' we mean that all terms on both sides of the equation have to have the same dimensions. Can you understand this concept?"

However, as we know from previous formulas that 'a' has the dimension of length (L). Similarly, inside the sine function, the term 't/a' implies 'a' should also have the dimensions of time (T) to cancel out with 't', which contradicts the defined dimensions of 'a'. Hence, this leads to a mismatch of dimensions, that's why it is dimensionally incorrect."

This discord leads to a mismatch of dimensions, confirming that formula (c) is indeed dimensionally incorrect. Now, let's proceed to the last formula (d): y = a\u221a2 ( sin(2\u03c0t/T) + cos(2\u03c0t/T) ). As with the previous formulas, our goal is to determine if this formula is dimensionally correct.
