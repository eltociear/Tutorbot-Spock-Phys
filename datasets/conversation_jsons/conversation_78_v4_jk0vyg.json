In this step, we want to identify our elements in the system. We begin with a single nucleus, initially at rest. This will break apart into two smaller nuclei. We're going to label the mass of the initial parent nucleus as 'm'. The masses of the two smaller daughter nuclei created after the disintegration we're going to label as 'm1' and 'm2'. Additionally, the velocities that the two daughter nuclei have after the disintegration will be labeled as 'v1' and 'v2'. These velocities will have directions indicated by the vectors attached to them. To solve the problem, could you write down these variables and their meanings as understood by you? This will help us solve the problem step by step. "
