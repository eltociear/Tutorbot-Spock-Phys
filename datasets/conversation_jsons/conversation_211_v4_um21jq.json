It'll be helpful to note that the different regions of the graph correspond to different phases of CO2: solid, liquid, and gas. Also, the lines on the graph represent phase changes. Additionally, there are points such as the triple point where all three phases can exist in equilibrium, and the critical point, beyond which gas and liquid phases become indistinguishable.

If the decrease in pressure would lower the fusion and boiling point, then for (b), a decrease in pressure should increase the fusion and boiling point of CO2. The critical temperatures and pressures for CO2 are probably just random points on the diagram. As for question (d), I believe at \u201370 \u00b0C under 1 atm CO2 would be a solid, at \u201360 \u00b0C under 10 atm it would be a liquid,  and at 15 \u00b0C under 56 atm it would be a gas."
