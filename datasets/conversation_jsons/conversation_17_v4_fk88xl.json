For example, to ascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its positions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind the discovery of radar in World War II. Think of different examples in modern science where precise measurements of length, time, mass etc., are needed. Also, wherever you can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed.\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

Knowing this, can you think of an application of this technology?"

For instance, data gets transferred through the fiber optics at blazing speeds and the measurement of these pulses must be highly accurate. Now, let's move to the the third step. In the field of quantum physics, precise measurements of length are needed such as in X-ray spectroscopy which allows us to find interatomic separation or distances. These distances are so small that they elude regular measuring tools. Can you think of an example where precise measurement of length is critical?"
