Then, when you square it, you get (4\u03c0)^2 = 16\u03c0^2 rad^2/s^2, not 16\u03c0 rad^2/s^2. Hence, your centripetal force should be calculated as 14.5 * 1 * (16\u03c0^2) = 2289.43 N, not 2883.01 N. So, by adding this to the gravitational force (142.1 N), we get a total force F = 1431.6 N + 2289.43 N = 3720.96 N. Now let's proceed to the next step, which is applying the Young\u2019s modulus equation to determine the elongation of the wire."
