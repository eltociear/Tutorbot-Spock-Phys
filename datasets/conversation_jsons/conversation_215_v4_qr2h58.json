Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a certain quantity of a substance by a certain degree. So if the two bodies have different capacities for storing heat, the one with the higher capacity would need more heat to increase to the mean temperature, and the one with lower capacity would need less heat to reach that mean temperature. Hence the equilibrium temperature would likely be closer to the temperature of the body with the higher specific heat capacity, not the mean of T1 and T2."

The centrifugal force due to the car's speed does not stretch the tyre and there is no increase in the volume of the tyre. The pressure increases because the air temperature inside the tyre rises due to the friction between the tyre and the road which increases the kinetic energy of the air molecules leading to a rise in air pressure.",

It states that volume of a gas increases with temperature, given constant pressure. Now, let's think about what happens in a car tyre when it's moving. The tyre is being constantly rubbed against the road, which produces heat. The heat causes the temperature of the air inside the tyre to rise. Considering that the volume of the tyre is fixed, what do you think might happen to the pressure of the air inside the tyre?"

It seems the student misunderstood the concept of Charles' Law in this context. The student needs to understand that when the air inside the tyre gets heated while driving, the pressure will increase, not decrease, due to fixed volume of the tyre.",

You've got the right concept with Charles' Law, but remember that in the case of a car tyre, the volume isn't increasing or decreasing because the space inside the tyre is limited. So, in case of a fixed volume, when the temperature rises (as a result of friction between the tyre and the road), the pressure should actually increase, not decrease. Can you try explaining it again?"

That's because the increased temperature makes the gas molecules move faster and collide with each other and the walls of the tyre more forcefully, nothing is pushing back against the pressure so the pressure increases. Let's try again with this in mind. Why does the air pressure in a car tyre increase during driving?"

So if the volume is constant and the tire's temperature increases due to the friction with the road, the air molecules inside the tire will move faster and collide more forcefully with the walls of the tire.

In the closed system of the tyre where the volume is fixed, the faster moving air molecules result in more forceful collisions with the tyre walls, leading to an increase in pressure.

            "from": "student",

So, during the day, the ocean absorbs and stores heat without its temperature rising as much as the land, so the land becomes hotter, and the warm air rises and is replaced by cooler air from over the ocean, causing a sea breeze which cools the coastal town. At night, the land cools down faster than the ocean, so the ocean is warmer than the land, and the warmer air over the ocean rises and is replaced by cooler air from the land, causing a land breeze which further cools the coastal town. In contrast, a desert has low thermal capacity and heats quickly during the day and cools quickly at night, causing big temperature fluctuations. Therefore, a harbor town has a more temperate climate than a desert town at the same latitude."

The high specific heat of water in the ocean helps to regulate the temperature by absorbing and releasing heat slowly, ensuring the temperature doesn't fluctuate as much as it does in a desert.

Do you have any other questions on this topic or any other topic?"
