First, we need to identify the known quantities in the question, we know that the mass of the bullet m1 is 0.012 kg and its initial speed u1 is 70 m/s. The block of wood's mass m2 is 0.4 kg, and its initial speed u2 is 0. The final speed of the bullet and the block together is represented as v m/s and we need to find it. Can you try to express the law of conservation of momentum for the bullet and the block as an equation using these quantities?"
