A child running a temperature of 101F is given an antipyrin (i.e. a medicine that lowers fever) which causes an increase in the rate of evaporation of sweat from his body. If the fever is brought down to 98 F in 20 minutes, what is the average rate of extra evaporation caused by the drug? Assume the evaporation mechanism to be the only way by which heat is lost. The mass of the child is 30 kg. The specific heat of the human body is approximately the same as that of water, and the latent heat of evaporation of water at that temperature is about 580 cal g^\u20131.\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

Let's begin with the first step where we list down the known values from the question, such as the initial and final temperatures, the child's mass, the time it took for the fever to reduce, the specific heat capacity, and the latent heat of evaporation. Convert the temperatures to Celsius (C) since we normally use that in heat calculations. The conversion formula from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius is (F-32) * (5/9). Also, convert the child's weight to grams (g) as we usually use that in thermal calculations. So, can you list down these values in Celsius and grams respectively?"
