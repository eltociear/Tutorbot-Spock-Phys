We need to remember that momentum is always conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions, according to one of the fundamental laws of physics. Can you briefly explain why the law of conservation of momentum applies here?"

However, the wall, being much more massive, undergoes essentially no change in its momentum. Therefore, the total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision, as long as we consider the system of the molecule and the wall."

The law of conservation of momentum applies because the total momentum before the collision, considering both the molecule and the wall, equals the total momentum after the collision. Now that we've confirmed momentum conservation, let's move to step 2. The problem tells us that the molecule approaches and rebounds off the wall at the same speed of 200 m/s. We denote this speed as 'u' for the initial speed, and 'v' for the final speed after the collision. That is, u = v = 200 m s^(\u20131). Is this clear?"

Now, moving on to the next step which is the calculation of the initial kinetic energy. We use the basic formula for kinetic energy, which is KE = (1/2) m u^2 where m is the mass of the molecule and u is its speed. Can you calculate the initial kinetic energy?"

However, since mass is a common factor in both the initial and final kinetic energies, we can compare their ratios, knowing that any difference due to the mass of the molecule will cancel out. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy can be expressed as KEinitial = (1/2) m u^2, with 'm' representing the unknown mass of the molecule. Now, let's move to next step of calculating the final kinetic energy. Similar to the initial kinetic energy, we denote it as KEfinal = (1/2) m v^2. With this, can you explain the comparison of the initial and final kinetic energies?"

Since the speed 'u' before the collision and 'v' after the collision is the same and equals 200 m/s, and the mass 'm' is the same as well, this means that the initial kinetic energy KEinitial should be equal to the final kinetic energy KEfinal. Therefore, the total kinetic energy before the collision is the same as the total kinetic energy after the collision."
