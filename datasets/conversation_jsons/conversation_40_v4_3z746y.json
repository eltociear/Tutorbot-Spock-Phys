In physics, scalar quantities are those that are fully described by their magnitude alone and don't involve a direction. A simple example would be the temperature - it has a specific value but does not have a direction. On the other hand, vector quantities include both a magnitude and direction, such as force or velocity. Can you tell me if 'force' or 'velocity' would be considered scalar quantities, given this information?"

Now we should proceed to step 2 and identify the scalar quantities in your list. Let's begin with 'work.' The definition of 'work' involves a dot product of force and displacement, both vector quantities. But the resultant, the work itself, is a scalar quantity. This comes from the work-energy theorem equation, W = F.d where W is work done, F is force, and d is displacement. Based on this description, would you say 'work' can qualify as a scalar quantity?"
