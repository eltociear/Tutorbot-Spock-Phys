We need to establish the problem: we are trying to determine whether an object will be able to stay affixed to the surface of a neutron star. For the object to stay on the surface of the star, the inward pull of gravity needs to be stronger than the outward push of centrifugal force. Therefore, we need to calculate both of these forces and compare them. Do you follow so far, or do you have any questions about this?"

Might we consider 'm' as negligible in comparison to 'M' since the other object's mass is likely much smaller than the star's mass?

The distance r from the center of the star to the surface is 12 km = 12,000 m. The gravitational constant G is 6.67 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. We can disregard 'm' temporarily because it will be present in the formula for both gravity and centrifugal force and they will be cancelled out eventually. So, using the formula, I calculate the gravitational pull as F = G*M/r\u00b2 = 6.67*10^-11 * 5*10^30 / (12,000)^2. Let's calculate this and find the gravity value."
