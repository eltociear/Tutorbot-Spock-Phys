We are given a cylinder that is completely insulated from its surroundings and contains hydrogen gas. The insulation indicates that no heat is exchanged between the system (the cylinder) and its surroundings. This is called an adiabatic process. Did you understand this and the concept of an adiabatic process?"

Actually, the pressure and volume are related by an equation called the 'Adiabatic Process Equation', represented as P1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3 for hydrogen gas. This equation is different than the Boyle's law (PV = constant), which applies to isothermal (constant temperature) processes. In our case, because heat exchange is prevented, the process is adiabatic, not isothermal. Let's continue with our process of determining the pressure change and we'll use the adiabatic process equation. Are you ready for the next step?"

Thus, we don't need to, and should not, equate the initial and final states of the system using this law. The pressure ratio P2/P1 you calculated is indeed right and that's all we needed to know how much the pressure contributes to the change in the system.
