When work is done against friction by a body, what do you think happens in terms of the body's energy?

Friction is a force that opposes movement, so energy used to overcome friction does not increase the body's kinetic or potential energy, but actually decreases it. Can you think again about what happens to kinetic energy when work is done against friction?"

When we're using energy to overcome friction, it causes the body to slow down or even stop, not increase in speed. Thus, the velocity decreases, and using our kinetic energy formula (1/2)mv^2, we see that the kinetic energy actually decreases, not increases. Let's try to think about it again."

Therefore, the potential energy remains constant. There's no work being done against gravity to change height here, so the potential energy isn't affected when work is done to overcome friction. It's the velocity that is affected due to the friction, and thereby, the kinetic energy decreases. Can we agree on this?"

However, the work against friction results in the decrease of velocity and subsequently the kinetic energy. But, what if the friction is so high that it stops the object completely? Wouldn't that make the kinetic energy go up, because the formula for kinetic energy is 1/2 mv^2, and if v is zero, doesn't that mean kinetic energy is maximum?"

Because, according to the kinetic energy formula 1/2 mv^2, if 'v' (velocity) is zero, then the whole formula becomes zero. Hence, the kinetic energy would be zero, not maximum. Would you like to consider this and try to explain the relationship between work done against friction, velocity, and kinetic energy again?"

            "from": "student",

This reduces its velocity and as a result the kinetic energy also decreases, because kinetic energy depends on both mass and velocity squared, and if velocity is zero the kinetic energy is also zero. So the work done against friction essentially changes into heat energy due to the rubbing of surfaces. The potential energy doesn't change because the height of the object isn't affected by the friction. Is that right?"

You've accurately described that when work is done against friction, it slows the object down by reducing its velocity, causing a decrease in its kinetic energy. You've also correctly concluded that the height of an object isn't affected by friction, so its potential energy remains constant. Excellent work in understanding these concepts!"
