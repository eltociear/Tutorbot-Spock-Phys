The correct original distance between the two trains should be the distance covered by B - distance covered by A = 2250 m - 1000 m = 1250 m. Not 1500 m as you calculated. With this, we've solved the problem and there are no more steps. Great effort and perseverance on your part. Don't worry, it's common to make small errors sometimes when calculating, just be sure to double check your work."
