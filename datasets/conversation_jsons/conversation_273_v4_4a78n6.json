Unlike a gas, the earth can experience both transverse (S) and longitudinal (P) sound waves. Typically the speed of the S wave is about 4.0 km s^\u20131, and that of the P wave is 8.0 km s^\u20131. A seismograph records P and S waves from an earthquake. The first P wave arrives 4 min before the first S wave. Assuming the waves travel in a straight line, at what distance does the earthquake occur?\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

The equation you've written implies that the S wave's time, t1, is only 4 minutes longer than the P wave's time, t2. However, with the given speed of the waves, the time difference would be more significant. If we rearrange the equation 4t1=8t2 we established earlier, we get t1 = 2t2. This means that the P wave travels in half the time than the S wave. Therefore, the difference in time between the S and P waves is not just 4 minutes but also includes the P wave's travel time. That's why we can't simply assume that the P wave travels for 4 minutes and the S wave for 8 minutes. Does that clarify things a bit?"
