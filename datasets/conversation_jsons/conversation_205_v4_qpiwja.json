This value matches with my calculation as well. Well done! Now let's advance to the final step. If there were any heat losses to the environment, it would reduce the observed change in the water's temperature and also lower the computed value for the metal's specific heat. Therefore, in the case of heat losses being relevant, would your calculated specific heat be greater or smaller than the actual specific heat of the metal?"
