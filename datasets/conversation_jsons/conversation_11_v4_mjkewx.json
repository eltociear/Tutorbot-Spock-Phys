The problem provides the percentage errors for measurements a, b, c, and d, respectively, as 1%, 3%, 4%, and 2%. It asks to determine the overall percentage error in the quantity P. Given the formula of P, the percentage error in P can be derived from the rules to calculate errors in physical quantities, where the powers in the formula of the quantity become coefficients in the formula for its error.
