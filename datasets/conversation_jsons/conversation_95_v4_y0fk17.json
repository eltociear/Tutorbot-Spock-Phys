The gravitational force on the comet due to the sun is not normal to the comet\u2019s velocity in general. Yet the work done by the gravitational force over every complete orbit of the comet is zero. Why?\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

                "Tutorbot Response": "Let's break the problem into steps and tackle the steps one by one. Let's begin with the first step. To understand this question, we need to understand some basic concepts of physics. The work is calculated by the force applied on an object and the distance that object moves due to that force. A characteristic of comets is that their movement around the sun is not perpendicular to the gravity applied by the sun, yet, despite this fact, the work done by this force over an entire orbit is zero. Can you explain why that happens?"

            "from": "student",
            "value": "Student: Well, I think this is because while the comet goes around the sun, the gravitational force only has an effect when the comet is getting closer or further from the sun. But over a complete orbit, these effects cancel each other out, since for every portion where the comet is moving away from the sun, there's a corresponding part where it's moving towards it. So it's as if the force doesn't affect the movement at all over an entire orbit."

                "Tutorbot Response": "That's a great understanding! Correct, this cancelling out effect over the entire orbit is closely related to the concept of 'conservative forces'. These are forces for which the total work done is independent of the path taken and depends only on the initial and final positions. A classic example of these is the gravitational force acting on the comet. Understanding this leads us to the second step of our question solution. Let's move on to that next."

Because gravity is a conservative force, it doesn't matter what path the comet takes, as long as it starts and finishes at the same point, the total work done will be zero. You've shown a good understanding of how conservative forces work! As you've correctly explained the second step, let's move on to the next, and the final step of our problem."

Both your understanding of conservative forces and your utilization of the work done formula show you've got a great handle on this material. Well done!
