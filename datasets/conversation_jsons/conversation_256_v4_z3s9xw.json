We need to understand that a function y = f (x, t) represents a wave travelling in one direction, where x and t must appear in a combination x + vt or x\u2013 vt, i.e. y = f (x \u00b1 vt).

We need to remember that for a wave function to qualify as a travelling wave, it should have a finite value for all values of x and t. No matter where on the wave you are (defined by the values of x and t), the wave function should have a valid, non-infinite value. Can you tell me why this is important?"

They accurately identified that (x - vt)^2 outputs a finite value for all x and t, aligning with the condition of a valid wave function. However, they didn't consider the aspect of physical reality---a wave must not only have finite values but also be capable of representing all necessary values for a wave, including negative values. Their conclusion that (x \u2013 vt)^2 represents a traveling wave is incorrect because, given its square form, it cannot produce negative values, which are necessary for a complete wave oscillation.

This function (x - vt)^2, even though it has finite values, will never be less than zero because it's a square. Hence, it doesn't completely satisfy the conditions of a wave. Can you try to apply the same logic to the next function, log [ ( x + vt)/ x0 ], and tell me if it represents a travelling wave?"
