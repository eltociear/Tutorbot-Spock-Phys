If an object has uniform mass density, then the mass is evenly spread throughout the object. I guess for basic shapes, the centre of mass would be at the geometrical centre if the density is uniform. However, I am not sure about the formula to use."

Also, the student correctly mentioned that the centre of mass would be at the geometrical centre for objects having uniform density. However, they are unsure about how to apply this understanding to find the centre of mass for the given shapes. They are not required to apply any formulas for this particular problem, so their mention of needing one suggests they might be slightly confused as to how to proceed.",

Also, your understanding that the centre of mass is at the geometrical centre for objects with uniform density is accurate. That's really great. To apply this understanding to the given shapes, you don't necessarily need a formula. Rather, you need to apply the concept you just explained. Let's move to the second step, keeping your understanding in mind, would you like to try expressing where the centre of mass for each of these shapes might be if the mass density is uniform?"

Similarly, for (ii) Cylinder, the centre of mass also lies at its geometric centre, but on the axis of symmetry. (iii) For a ring, the centre of mass should be at the centre of the ring, but since the ring itself is empty, it's technically outside the body of the ring. And finally, (iv) for a cube, like the sphere and cylinder, the centre of mass should be at its geometric centre. Is this correct?"

As you've understood, it's about distribution of mass, and not necessarily about whether there is a material in that exact spot or not. Now, let's move to the final part of the question. Does the centre of mass of a body always lies inside the body? What do you think about this situation?"
