These properties of laser light can be exploited to measure long distances. The distance of the Moon from the Earth has already been determined very precisely using a laser as a source of light. A laser light beamed at the Moon takes 2.56 s to return after reflection at the Moon\u2019s surface. How much is the radius of the lunar orbit around the Earth?\n\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

In this situation, we're given a total round-trip time for the laser light to travel from Earth to the Moon and back. This round-trip time is 2.56 seconds. To find the radius of the lunar orbit around the Earth, we need to first figure out the one-way travel time taken by the laser beam to reach the Moon from Earth. Can you tell me what we need to do with the total time of 2.56 seconds to get the one-way travel time?"

We know that the speed of light (which is the speed of the laser light) is a constant value, c = 3 x 10^8 m/s. We can use the formula distance equals speed times time, or d = c * t. But remember, the 'd' here is not the round-trip distance but the distance to the Moon i.e. the radius of the lunar orbit around the Earth. After finding the one-way time like we did in the previous step, our formula will now look like this: d = c*t/2. Can you substitute the values into this equation and calculate the distance?"
