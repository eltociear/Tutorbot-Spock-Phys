At the displacement antinode, where the particles of the medium are displaced the furthest from their equilibrium positions, the corresponding pressure should also be at its maximum (pressure node) - right? Because it should be where the wave's compression and rarefaction are the strongest, leading to the greatest pressure variance.

It relies on the natural technique known as echolocation to locate, identify, and hunt down its prey. Echolocation is a process of emitting sound waves that when it hits an object, it produces echoes that provide information about the object's size, shape, speed, distance, and location. Dolphins are known to have perfected this technique. So, their blindness doesn't deter them from living a near-normal life. But I am not sure about their frequency range or how exactly they differentiate between objects or prey."

What makes us distinguish between the two sounds is not the pitch, but the 'timbre.' Timbre refers to the characteristic or quality of a sound that makes it unique. Can you explain how 'overtones' contribute to creating a unique timbre for each instrument?"

It's actually about how strong or weak these overtones are, which gives each instrument their unique timbre. But overall, you've got the main point! Let's now proceed to the fourth part about wave propagation: Could you explain why both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate through solids, but only longitudinal waves can move through gases?"

For gases, they have elasticity but lack rigidity so they can only support waves that require a restoring force arising from changes in volume (longitudinal waves) and not from changes in shape (transverse waves). Receiving or transmitting information with transverse waves is impossible in gases because they don't have the necessary organized arrangement or rigidity which solids possess.

Can you try illustrating the concept of dispersion with this adjustment?"
