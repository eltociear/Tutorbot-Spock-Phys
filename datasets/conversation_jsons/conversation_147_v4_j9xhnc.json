We indeed have g' = 4g/9, which means the gravitational acceleration at a height equal to half the earth's radius is four-ninths of the surface acceleration. This is a significant reduction in gravity. Let's now move to the next step and determine the weight of the body at that height. Remember, weight is given by the product of mass and gravitational acceleration. Since mass is weight divided by surface gravity, we can write the weight of the body at the required height, W', as W' = m * (4g/9) = (4/9)*W. Can you apply this formula?"
