The first vessel contains neon (monatomic), the second contains chlorine (diatomic), and the third contains uranium hexafluoride (polyatomic). Do the vessels contain an equal number of respective molecules? Is the root mean square speed of molecules the same in the three cases? If not, in which case are Vrms the largest?\" Break it down and guide me through step by step."

To begin with, we should note that we have three vessels of the same capacity containing gases at the same temperature and pressure. Based on this, what can we infer about the conditions of the gases in the three vessels?"

However, because the gases are different, I believe their root mean square speed would differ due to their different molecular masses under the equation Vrms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molar mass."

The student also correctly pointed out that the different molecular masses of the gases would result in different root mean square velocities. The student seems to have a good grasp of the concepts needed to solve this problem. Therefore, I must now confirm their correct response and move on to the next part of the problem.",

And you're correct that the root mean square speed should differ because of the varying molecular masses. We are making good progress! Let's dig deeper. Do you remember how to find the root mean square speed for these gases?"

If I recall correctly, I should substitute the R value with the ideal gas constant in the appropriate units, substitute the T value with the temperature in Kelvin, and for M, I need to put in the molar mass in kilograms per mole. Is that correct?"

The equation for Vrms = \u221a3RT / M indeed requires the gas constant and temperature in the appropriate units, and the mass should be in kilograms per mole. You're understanding the concepts quite well! Now, moving forward, given that 'R' and 'T' are constants since they are the same for all three gases, what can you infer about the relationship between the root mean square speed and mass of the atoms? Consider the equation Vrms \u221d (1/m)^(1/2)."

            "from": "student",
            "value": "Well, from the equation Vrms \u221d (1/m)^(1/2), it seems that the root mean square speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the atoms or molecules. So, if a gas has a larger molar mass, it should have a slower root mean square speed, and vice versa. Therefore, neon, having the smallest molar mass among the three gases, should have the highest root mean square speed. Then comes chlorine, and uranium hexafluoride should have the slowest root mean square speed due to its large molar mass. Is this correct?"
