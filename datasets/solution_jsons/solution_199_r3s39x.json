    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Extract the known quantities from the problem. The initial diameter of the hole (D1) in the copper sheet was given as 4.24 cm and the initial temperature (T1) was 27.0 C. The temperature was heated to a final temperature (T2) of 227 C. Additionally, we are given the coefficient of linear expansion for copper (\u03b1) as 1.70 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1). Step 2) Convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. Add 273 to each temperature to ensure accurate calculations in the following steps. T1 will be 300 K and T2 will be 500 K. Step 3) Calculate the area for the initial hole (Ao) using the formula for the area of a circle, \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(D1/2)^2. Step 4) Compute the value for the coefficient of superficial expansion (\u03b2) by multiplying the coefficient of linear expansion by 2.  Step 5) Plug the known quantities (Ao, \u03b2, and the change in temperature (\u0394T=500-300=200 K)) into the formula which measures change in area due to temperature (A = Ao( 1 + \u03b2\u0394T)). This calculation will yield the final area (A). Step 6) Solve for the final diameter (D2) by rearranging the terms of the formula for the area of a circle. Compare the area of the hole at T2, \u03c0(D2)^2/4 to the area of the hole at T1, \u03c0(D1/2)^2, multiplied by the factor (1+\u03b2\u0394T). Simplify to isolate D2. Step 7) Compute the numerical change in diameter between the initial size and final size, \u0394D = D2 - D1, which is found to be 0.013 cm.",

Step 6) Rearrange the formula of area= \u03c0r^2 to solve for the final diameter (D2). Step 7) Finally compute the change in diameter (\u0394D) using the formula, \u0394D = D2 - D1."
