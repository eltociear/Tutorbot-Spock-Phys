    "Question": "Q14. A man walks on a straight road from his home to a market 2.5 km away at aspeed of 5 km/h. Finding the market closed, he instantly turns and walks backhome with a speed of 7.5 km h^\u20131. What is the(a) Magnitude of average velocity, and(b) Average speed of the man over the interval of time (i) 0 to 30 min, (ii) 0 to 50 min, (iii) 0 to 40 min? \r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Distance to the market = 2.5 km = 2500 m\r\nSpeed of the man  walking to the market= 5 km/h = 5 x (5/18) = 1.388 m/s\r\nSpeed of the man walking when he returns back home = 7.5 km/h = 7.5  x (5/18) = 2.08 m/s\r\n(a) Magnitude of the average speed is zero since the displacement is zero\r\n(b)\r\n(i) Time taken to reach the market = Distance/Speed = 2500/1.388 = 1800 seconds = 30 minutes\r\nSo, the average speed over 0 to 30 minutes is 5 km/h or  1.388 m/s\r\n(ii) Time taken to reach back home = Distance/Speed = 2500/2.08 = 1200 seconds = 20 minutes\r\nSo, the average speed is\r\nAverage speed over a interval of 50 minutes= distance covered/time taken = (2500 + 2500)/3000 = 5000/3000 = 5/3 = 1.66 m/s\r\n= 6 km/h\r\n(ii) Average speed over an interval of 0-40 minutes = distance covered/ time taken = (2500+ 1250)/2400 = 1.5625 seconds = 5.6 km/h",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, understand the problem. A man is walking from his home to a market which is 2.5 km away at a speed of 5 km/h. He then returns home instantly at a speed of 7.5 km/h after finding the market closed. We need to find average velocity and average speed. Step 2) To begin, we convert the given distances and speeds into standard units. Kilometers (km) are converted to meters (m) and kilometers per hour (km/h) are converted to meters per second (m/s) for consistency and ease of calculation. Hence, the distance to the market is 2500 m, speed while going to the market is 1.388 m/s and speed while returning is 2.08 m/s. Step 3) Now, to calculate the average velocity, remember that velocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. In this case, the man starts from his home, goes to the market, and then returns home. So overall, his displacement (change in position) is zero because he ends up back where he started. Thus, the average velocity is zero. Step 4) For the average speed, we first need to calculate the time taken in each direction. Remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. The time taken to reach the market is 30 minutes and the time taken to return to home is 20 minutes. Step 5) Now we calculate the average speed for different time intervals as asked in the question: i) For the interval 0 to 30 min, the man is still at the market. Hence, the total distance travelled is 2500 m or 2.5 km and the total time taken is 30 minutes. So, the average speed is distance/time which equals 5 km/h or 1.388 m/s. ii) For the interval 0 to 50 min, the man has returned home. So, the total distance travelled is 5000 m or 5 km. This implies that the average speed is 6 km/h or 1.66 m/s. iii) For the interval 0 to 40 min, the man is still on his way home. Therefore, the total distance travelled is 3750 m or 3.75 km, giving us an average speed of 5.6 km/h or 1.5625 m/s.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We identify that a man is walking a certain distance to a market and back at differing speeds. We need to find average velocity and speed for various times. Step 2) We convert distances and speeds into meters and meters per second respectively for uniformity and easier calculation. Step 3) We calculate average velocity. Keep in mind that velocity has a direction. Since the man ends up where he started, his overall displacement is zero. Therefore, the average velocity is zero as well. Step 4) We calculate the time taken to travel to the market and back using the formula time=distance/speed. Step 5) We calculate the average speed for different periods: (i) For 0 to 30 min, the man is at the market so the distance travelled is the distance to the market. (ii) For 0 to 50 min, the man has returned home so the distance travelled is twice the distance to the market. (iii) For 0 to 40 min, the man is still en route so the distance travelled is more than that to the market but less than twice the distance."
