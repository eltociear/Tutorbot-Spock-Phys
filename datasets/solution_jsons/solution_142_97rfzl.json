    "Question": "8. A comet orbits the Sun in a highly elliptical orbit. Does the comet have a constant (a) linear speed (b) angular speed (c) angular momentum (d) kinetic energy (e) potential energy (f) total energy throughout its orbit? Neglect any mass loss of the comet when it comes very close to the Sun.",
    "Original Solution": "(a) According to Kepler\u2019s second law, the linear speed of the comet keeps changing. When the comet is near the sun, its speed will be the fastest, and when it is far away from the sun, its speed will be the least.\r\n(b) Angular speed also varies slightly.\r\n(c) Comet has constant angular momentum.\r\n(d) Kinetic energy changes.\r\n(e) Potential energy changes along the path.\r\n(f) Total energy will remain constant throughout the orbit",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Starting with the first part of our problem, we need to determine if the comet's linear speed is constant during its orbit. Using Kepler\u2019s second law, which states that a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times, we know that the linear speed of the comet is not constant. In essence, when the comet is near the sun it moves faster, covering a larger arc of its orbit, and when it's far from the sun, it moves slower, covering a smaller arc. The speed of the comet therefore changes depending on its distance from the sun. \nStep 2) Continuing to the second part of our problem, we need to find out if the comet's angular speed is constant. The angular speed also carries dependence on the location of the comet in its orbit. It varies slightly due to the comet's elliptical path around the sun, not remaining constant throughout the orbit.\nStep 3) Next, we address if the comet maintains constant angular momentum throughout its orbit. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, the angular momentum of the comet does remain constant. This principle states that the total angular momentum does not change unless acted on by an external torque. In other words, the speed and direction of the comet may change, but its angular momentum remains the same.\nStep 4) We move onto the kinetic energy aspect of the problem. The kinetic energy changes as the comet changes its speed (either accelerating or decelerating) along its orbit. Hence, the more the comet's speed changes, the more the kinetic energy changes as well.\nStep 5) Fifthly, we consider the comet's potential energy. Potential energy is associated with the comet's position in relation to the gravitational pull of the sun and also varies along the orbit. The further the comet is from the sun, the higher the potential energy, and vice versa.\nStep 6) Lastly, we need to determine if the comet's total energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant throughout its orbit. Although the kinetic energy and potential energy fluctuate, the total energy of the comet stays constant. This is due to the conservation of energy law, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We utilize Kepler's second law to ascertain that the comet's linear speed is not constant, as it varies based on the comet's location in its orbit around the sun.\nStep 2) The angular speed of the comet is not constant and also slightly varies as a result of the elliptical orbit. \nStep 3) Using the principle of conservation of angular momentum, we determine that the comet's angular momentum remains constant throughout its orbit.\nStep 4) Given that kinetic energy is tied to the speed of the comet, as the comet's speed changes, so does its kinetic energy.\nStep 5) The potential energy, which is related to the comet's distance from the sun, changes along the orbit. \nStep 6) Despite fluctuations in kinetic and potential energy, the total energy of the comet (kinetic energy + potential energy) remains constant due to the law of conservation of energy."
