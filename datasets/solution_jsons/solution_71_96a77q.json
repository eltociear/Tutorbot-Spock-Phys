    "Question": "8. The driver of a three-wheeler moving at a speed of 36 km/h sees a child standing in the middle of the road and brings his vehicle to rest in 4.0 s just in time to save the child. What is the average retarding force on the vehicle? The mass of the three-wheeler is 400 kg, and the mass of the driver is 65 kg.\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nInitial velocity, u= 36 km/h\r\nFinal velocity, v = 0\r\nMass of the three-wheeler, m1= 400 Kg\r\nMass of the driver, m2 = 65 Kg\r\nTime taken to bring the vehicle to rest = 4.0 s\r\nAcceleration, a = v- u/t = (0 \u2013 10)/ 4 = \u2013 2.5 m/s\r\nNow, F = (m1 + m2)/ a = (400 + 65) x (-2.5)\r\n= \u2013 1162.5 N = \u2013 1.16 x 10^3 N\r\nThe negative sign shows that the force is retarding",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify all given values: u (initial velocity) = 36 km/h, v (final velocity) = 0, m1 (mass of the three-wheeler) = 400 Kg, m2 (mass of the driver) = 65 Kg, t (time taken to bring the vehicle to rest) = 4.0 seconds. These values are required to determine the retarding force. Step 2) Convert the initial velocity from km/h to m/s to maintain coherence in units. This is done due to the metric system, where units should match when performing calculations. Since 1 km/h is equivalent to approximately 0.278 m/s, we multiply 36 km/h by 0.278, which equals 10 m/s. Step 3) Calculate the acceleration, noted as 'a'. We use the equation a = (v - u)/t, which represents the rate at which an object changes its velocity. Substituting the given values gives a = (0 - 10) /4 = -2.5 m/s^2.  The negative sign indicates a deceleration or slowing down. Step 4) Solve for the total force 'F', which is the sum of the forces on both the three-wheeler and the driver, using F = (m1 + m2)*a. Substituting the given values gives F = (400 + 65) * -2.5 = -1162.5 N. The negative sign indicates that the force is acting against the initial direction of motion ie., it's retarding force.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify all given values including initial and final velocity, mass of the three-wheeler and driver, and time taken to stop. Step 2) Convert the initial velocity from km/h to m/s for consistency in unit measurements. Step 3) Use the formula for acceleration to calculate the rate of velocity change, giving us deceleration due to the negative sign. Step 4) Use the formula F = (m1 + m2) * a to find the total force acting on both the three-wheeler and the driver, resulting in a negative number showing a retarding force."
