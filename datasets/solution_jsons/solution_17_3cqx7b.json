    "Question": "2.21 Precise measurements of physical quantities are a need for science. For example, to ascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its positions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind the discovery of radar in World War II. Think of different examples in modern science where precise measurements of length, time, mass etc., are needed. Also, wherever you can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed.",
    "Original Solution": "Precise measurement is essential for the development of science. The ultra-short laser pulse is used for measurement of time intervals. X-ray spectroscopy is used to find the interatomic separation. To measure the mass of atoms, the mass spectrometer is developed.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin by understanding why precise measurements are integral to scientific discovery and progress. Precise measurements have been historically fundamental to various technologies and scientific achievements, a prime example being the discovery and development of radar during World War II to determine aircraft position and speed.\n\nStep 2) Consider one of the many examples in modern science where precise measurements of time are needed: the use of ultra-short laser pulses. These laser pulses, which can last as briefly as a few femtoseconds (1 femtosecond = 1 quadrillionth of a second), are vital in measuring extremely small time intervals. Their precise emission enables the detailed study of rapid processes such as molecular dynamics in chemical reactions.\n\nStep 3) Exploring another sophisticated measurement area, consider X-ray spectroscopy to find interatomic separation or distances. The distances between atoms in a molecule are so tiny that you cannot use any regular metric tool. Instead, we use X-ray spectroscopy, which is a method where X-rays are shot onto a material, and the scattered X-rays reveal the distances between atoms.\n\nStep 4) Lastly, think about measuring the mass of atoms. The atomic mass is so minute that conventional scales cannot capture it. Here's where we deploy the mass spectrometer. It functions by ionizing chemical compounds and sorting the ions based on their mass to charge ratio; hence, the mass of atoms can be precisely determined.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Acknowledge the fundamental role precise measurements play in scientific advancement using the example of radar technology from World War II.\n\nStep 2) Identify the use of ultra-short laser pulses in modern science as a means of precisely measuring very small time intervals, useful in studying rapid chemical processes.\n\nStep 3) Discuss the significant role of X-ray spectroscopy in finding the interatomic separation, which allows the quantification of extremely small distances inaccessible with standard measurement tools.\n\nStep 4) Highlight the use of a mass spectrometer in the area of measuring tiny atomic masses, demonstrating the importance of precision in scientific measurements."
