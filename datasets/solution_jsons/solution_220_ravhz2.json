    "Question": "8. An electric heater supplies heat to a system at a rate of 100W. If system performs work at a rate of 75 joules per second. At what rate is the internal energy increasing?",
    "Original Solution": "According to law of conservation of energy\r\nTotal energy = work done + internal energy\r\n\u0394Q = \u0394W + \u0394U\r\nHere,\r\nRate at which heat is supplied \u0394Q = 100 W\r\nRate at which work is done \u0394W = 75 Js-1\r\nRate of change of internal energy is \u0394U\r\n\u0394U = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394W\r\n\u0394U = 100 \u2013 75\r\nWe get,\r\n\u0394U = 25 J s-1\r\nHence,\r\nThe internal energy of the system is increasing at a rate of 25 W",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem involves three main variables: The rate at which heat is supplied (\u0394Q), the rate at which work is done (\u0394W), and the rate at which the internal energy changes (\u0394U). According to the law of conservation of energy, the sum of \u0394Q must equal the sum of \u0394W and \u0394U. This can be expressed as \u0394Q = \u0394W + \u0394U. Step 2) From the provided problem, the rate at which heat is supplied \u0394Q is given as 100 Watts and the rate at which work is done \u0394W is 75 Joules per second. Step 3) With \u0394Q and \u0394W known, we can find \u0394U by rearranging the conservation of energy formula to isolate \u0394U on one side. The equation becomes: \u0394U = \u0394Q - \u0394W. Step 4) Substituting known values, we get \u0394U = 100 - 75. Step 5) Solving this equation, the rate of change of internal energy \u0394U comes out to be 25 J s-1. Thus, the internal energy of the system is increasing at a rate of 25 W.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Apply the law of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy pumped into the system should equal the sum of work done and change in internal energy, or \u0394Q = \u0394W + \u0394U. Step 2) Identify the known given values in the question, in this case, \u0394Q, the rate at which the energy is being added is 100W and \u0394W, the rate at which work is performed is 75 J/s. Step 3) Rearrange the conservation of energy equation to solve for the unknown variable, \u0394U: \u0394U = \u0394Q - \u0394W. Step 4) Substitute the known \u0394Q and \u0394W values into the equation. Step 5) Solve for \u0394U, which represents the rate at which the internal energy of the system is increasing. This turns out to be 25 J/s, or equivalently, 25 W."
