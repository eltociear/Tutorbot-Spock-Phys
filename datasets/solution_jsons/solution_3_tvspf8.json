    "Question": "2.5 A new unit of length is chosen such that the speed of light in a vacuum is unity. What is the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes 8 min and 20 s to cover this distance?",
    "Original Solution": "Distance between them = Speed of light x Time taken by light to cover the distance\r\nSpeed of light = 1 unit\r\nTime taken = 8 x 60 + 20 = 480 + 20 = 500s\r\nThe distance between Sun and Earth = 1 x 500 = 500 units",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step in this problem is to recognize the given facts. We know that the speed of light in a vacuum with the newly chosen unit is 1. We also know that it takes the light 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. Step 2) The next step is to convert this given time into seconds for convenience and standardization. We do this by multiplying the minutes by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute) and adding the remaining seconds. This gives us 8*60 + 20 which equals 480 + 20, resulting in 500 seconds. Step 3) The final step is to calculate the distance between the Sun and the Earth. We do this by applying the equation for distance, which is the speed of light (in our new unit) multiplied by the time taken by light to cover the distance. Here, the speed of light is 1 unit and the time taken is 500 seconds. So the distance is 1*500, which equals 500 units. Thus, the distance between the Sun and the Earth in our new unit of length is 500 units.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values: the speed of light in the new unit (1 unit) and the time light takes to travel from the Sun to the Earth (8 minutes 20 seconds). Step 2) Convert the given time into seconds, using the reasoning that it's the standard metric for such calculations. This results in a total of 500 seconds. Step 3) Apply the standard distance equation: Speed x Time, which in this case is 1 unit (the speed of light) x 500 seconds (the time). Hence, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 500 units in the newly established measurement system."
