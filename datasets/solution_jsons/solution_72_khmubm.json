    "Question": "9. A rocket with a lift-off mass of 20,000 kg is blasted upwards with an initial acceleration of 5.0 ms^(-2). Calculate the initial thrust (force) of the blast.",
    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass of the rocket, m = 20000 kg = 2 x 10^4 kg\r\nInitial acceleration = 5 ms^(-2)\r\ng = 9.8 m/s^2\r\nThe initial thrust (force) should give an upward acceleration of 5 ms^(-2) and should overcome the force of gravity.\r\nThus, the thrust should produce a net acceleration of 9.8 + 5.0 = 14.8 ms^(-2).\r\nUsing Newton\u2019s second law of motion, the initial thrust acting on the rocket\r\nThrust = force = mass x acceleration\r\nF = 20000 x 14.8 = 2.96 x 10^5 N",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with identifying the given values from the problem: the mass (m) of the rocket = 20,000 kg, which can be expressed as 2*10^4 kg in scientific notation. The initial acceleration = 5 ms^(-2). Also, remember that the acceleration due to gravity (g) is a constant with the value of 9.8 m/s^2. \\\nStep 2) From the problem statement, we understand that the thrust from the rocket not only has to provide for the upward acceleration of 5 ms^(-2), but it also has to overcome the force of gravity acting downwards. This means that the net acceleration that the rocket's thrust needs to provide is the sum of these two - that's 9.8 + 5.0 = 14.8 ms^(-2). \\\nStep 3) To find the force, we make use of Newton's second law of motion which states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma).\\\nStep 4) We substitute the known values into this formula. The force 'F' then becomes the mass of the rocket (20000 kg) times its acceleration (14.8 ms^(-2)). That is, F = 20000 * 14.8 = 2.96 * 10^5 N.\\\nStep 5) As a result, the initial thrust (force) of the blast is 2.96 x 10^5 N. This is the force required to propel the rocket upwards at the desired acceleration while also overcoming the force of gravity.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values: mass of the rocket = 2 x 10^4 kg, initial acceleration = 5 ms^(-2) and acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s^2. \\\nStep 2) Realize that the thrust from the rocket has to provide for the upward acceleration and also counter the downwards force of gravity. So, the net acceleration it has to provide is the sum of both - 14.8 ms^(-2). \\\nStep 3) Employ Newton's second law of motion (F = ma) to compute the force based on the known mass and computed acceleration. \\\nStep 4) Plug in the given values into the formula to compute the force, resulting in F = 2.96 * 10^5 N. \\\nStep 5) Thus, the initial thrust force needed is found to be 2.96 x 10^5 N."
