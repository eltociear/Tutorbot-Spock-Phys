    "Question": "2.26. It is claimed that two caesium clocks, if allowed to run for 100 years, free from any disturbance, may differ by only about 0.02 s. What does this imply for the accuracy of the standard caesium clock in measuring a time interval of 1 s?",
    "Original Solution": "Total time = 100 years = 100 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 s\r\nError in 100 years = 0.02 s\r\nError in 1 second=0.02/100 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60\r\n=6.34 x 10^(-12) s\r\nThe accuracy of the standard caesium clock in measuring a time-interval of 1 s is 10^(-12) s.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem starts with understanding the given data: We know that two caesium clocks may have a difference of 0.02 seconds in 100 years if they are allowed to run undisturbed. Step 2) We first need to convert the total time of 100 years into seconds for consistent units. To do this we multiply 100 years by the number of days in a year (365), hours in a day (24), minutes in an hour (60), and seconds in a minute (60). Step 3) This gives us the total time of 100 years in seconds which we find to be 100 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 seconds. Step 4) We are informed that the error in 100 years is 0.02 seconds. Step 5) To find the error in 1 second we simply divide the total error by the total time, which is done by taking 0.02 divided by 100 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60. Step 6) After carrying out this division we discover the error in 1 second is 6.34 x 10^(-12) seconds. Step 7) The decimal and negative exponent show that this is a very small error, implying that the accuracy of the standard caesium clock in measuring a time interval of 1 second is extremely high. Step 8) More precisely, we can generalize this accuracy as 10^(-12) seconds, taking into account the significant figures of the measurement.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Start by recognizing that we are given a total time of 100 years and an error of 0.02 seconds. Step 2) Convert the total time from years to seconds using the relationship between years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This gives 100 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 seconds. Step 3) Determine the total error in a comparable time unit - here it is 0.02 seconds for the entire 100 years. Step 4) To find the error per second, divide the total error by the total time, which is given by the equation 0.02/(100 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60). Step 5) This calculation gives an error value for each second. Step 6) Recognize that this is a very small error, implying a high accuracy for the standard caesium clock in measuring 1 second intervals. Step 7) We generalize this accuracy as on the order of 10^(-12) seconds to respect the significant figures of the measurement."
