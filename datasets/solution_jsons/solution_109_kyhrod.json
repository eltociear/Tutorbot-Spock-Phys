    "Question": "19. A trolley of mass 300 kg carrying a sandbag of 25 kg is moving uniformly with a speed of 27 km/h on a frictionless track. After a while, the sand starts leaking out of a hole on the floor of the trolley at the rate of0.05 kg s^(\u20131). What is the speed of the trolley after the entire sandbag is empty?",
    "Original Solution": "The sandbag is placed in the trolley that moves with a uniform velocity of 27 km/h. There is no external force acting system. Even if the sand starts leaking out of the bag, there will not be any external force acting on the system. So, the speed of the trolley will not change. It will be equal to 27 km/h.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by acknowledging the given variables. The trolley has a mass of 300 kg and it carries a sandbag of 25 kg, thus total system mass is 325 kg. This system is moving at a speed of 27 km/h. The sand is leaking out of the bag at the rate of 0.05 kg s^(\u20131). The question is asking us to determine the speed of the trolley after all the sand from the sandbag has leaked out. Step 2) It's important to understand the key principle here, the conservation of linear momentum, which states that unless an external force acts upon it, the total momentum of an isolated system will remain constant. Step 3) Now, in our scenario, the action of the sand leaking out from the trolley can be seen as a small internal force within the system. As we have no external forces acting on this system (the trolley is moving uniformly on a frictionless track), the conservation of linear momentum principle applies. Step 4) Therefore, even as the sand leaks out, the total linear momentum before and after the sand has leaked out will remain the same (since the leaking sand is an internal force). Step 5) Lastly, it's important to remember that the speed of any object is directly related to its momentum. Therefore, even after the sandbag is emptied, the momentum (and thus speed) of the trolley remains the same. So, the trolley will continue to move at its original speed, 27 km/h.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given variables - initial speed of the trolley-sandbag system and the rate at which the sand is leaking. Step 2) Recall the principle of conservation of linear momentum which mandates the momentum of an isolated system, subjected to no external forces, remains constant. Step 3) Apply this principle to our given scenario, treating the sand leak as an internal force. Step 4) Understand that the total linear momentum of the trolley remains unchanged before and after the sandbag is emptied. Step 5) Conclude that the speed of the trolley remains as 27 km/h even after the entire sandbag is empty as the momentum hasn't changed."
