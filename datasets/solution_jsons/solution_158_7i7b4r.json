    "Question": "Q4. Read the following two statements below carefully and state, with reasons, if it is true or false.\r\n(a) The Young\u2019s modulus of rubber is greater than that of steel;\r\n(b) The stretching of a coil is determined by its shear modulus.",
    "Original Solution": "( a ) True. Stretching a coil does not change its length; only its shape is altered, and this involves shear modulus.\r\n( b ) False. This is because, for the same value of stress, there is more strain in rubber than in steel. And as Young Modulus is an inverse of strain, it is greater in steel.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) This question presents two statements about the mechanical properties of materials and asks you to determine whether these statements are true or false. First, it is useful to understand the basic concepts. Young's modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It defines the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation) in a material. A high Young's modulus means a material is stiffer. On the other hand, shear modulus is a measure of the material's ability to resist shape changes (shear deformation) when subjected to shear stress. \nStep 2) We tackle the first statement: 'The Young\u2019s modulus of rubber is greater than that of steel.' For the same value of stress, there is more strain in rubber than in steel. The reason behind this is that rubber is more flexible and more prone to deformation under the same load compared to steel. \nStep 3) As Young's modulus is an inverse of strain (strains like stretching or bending), the more a material tends to deform for a given stress, the lower its Young\u2019s modulus will be. Hence, it is safe to conclude that Young\u2019s modulus of rubber is less than that of steel, not greater. Therefore, the first statement is false.\nStep 4) Now let's consider the second statement: 'The stretching of a coil is determined by its shear modulus.' It's important to understand the concept of 'stretching a coil' here; stretching a coil involves changing its shape, not its length. When a coil is stretched, the material does not experience a simple extension but a shear deformation.\nStep 5) The shear modulus comes into play when deformation of the material happens without a change in volume, like when the shape of a coil is changed by stretching it. So, it is true that the shear modulus determines the stretching of a coil. Therefore, the second statement is true.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the terms Young's modulus and shear modulus as they are measures of stiffness and ability to resist shape change in materials, respectively.\nStep 2) Address the first statement about Young's modulus of rubber being greater than steel by assessing the strain in both materials for the same value of stress. As rubber deforms more, its Young's modulus is thus lower than that of steel.\nStep 3) Confirm that the first statement is false due to the inverse relationship between Young's modulus and strain.\nStep 4) Analyze the second statement about the role of shear modulus in the stretching of a coil, considering that stretching a coil leads to a shape change, not a length change.\nStep 5) Agree that the second statement is true as the shear modulus is responsible for resisting deformation in shape, as seen in a stretched coil."
