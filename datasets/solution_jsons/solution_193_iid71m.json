    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The known values from the problem statement are the temperatures in Kelvin (K) of the triple points of neon and carbon dioxide, respectively: 24.57 K and 216.55 K. Step 2) To express these temperatures in Celsius, we use the relation between Kelvin and Celsius scales given as TC = TK \u2013 273.15. It's important to note that this conversion stems from absolute zero, or 0K, being equivalent to -273.15 degrees Celsius. This equation directly changes a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius. Step 3) Applying Equation (1), for neon we calculate TC as 24.57 - 273.15, resulting in -248.58 degrees Celsius. Similarly, for carbon dioxide we calculate TC as 216.55 - 273.15, resulting in -56.60 degrees Celsius. Step 4) To express these temperatures in Fahrenheit, we use the equation TF = (9/5) * TC + 32. This conversion is based on the freezing and boiling points of water being set at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 212 degrees Fahrenheit respectively, which helps in getting the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Step 5) Applying Equation (2), for neon we calculate TF as (9/5) * (-248.58) + 32, yielding -415.44 degrees Fahrenheit. Similarly, for carbon dioxide we calculate TF as (9/5) * (-56.60) + 32, resulting in -69.88 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given temperatures of the triple point in Kelvin scale, which are 24.57 K for neon and 216.55 K for carbon dioxide. Step 2) Use the relation TC = TK \u2013 273.15 to convert from Kelvin to Celsius. Remember, this equation is based on the equivalence of absolute zero in both scales. Step 3) Plug in the known values in Kelvin into the equation and solve to get the temperatures in Celsius for neon and carbon dioxide, which are -248.58 C and -56.60 C, respectively. Step 4) To translate the temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, we use the formula TF = (9/5) * TC + 32, which is a conversion based on the temperature scale's relation to the freezing and boiling points of water. Step 5) Insert the temperatures in Celsius into the Fahrenheit conversion formula and calculate. The resulting temperatures are -415.44 F for neon and -69.88 F for carbon dioxide."
