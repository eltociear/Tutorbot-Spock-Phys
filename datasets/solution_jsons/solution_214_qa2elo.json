    "Question": "2. What amount of heat must be supplied to 2.0 \u00d7 10^-2 kg of nitrogen (at room temperature) to raise its temperature by 45 C at constant pressure? (Molecular mass of N2 = 28; R = 8.3 J mol^-1 K^-1.)",
    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass of nitrogen = 2 x 10^-2 kg\r\n= 20 g\r\nRise in temperature = \u0394T\r\n= 450 C\r\nHeat required = Q =?\r\nQ = nCT\r\nWe know,\r\nC = 7R / 2 (diatomic molecule)\r\nC = 7 x 8.3 / 2\r\nn (no. of moles) = w / m\r\nwhere,\r\nw = 20 g\r\nm = 28 u\r\nn = 20 / 28\r\nn = 1/ 1.4 moles\r\nLet the temperature be 45 K\r\nQ = 10 / 14 x 7 / 2 x 8.3 x 45\r\nWe get,\r\nQ = 933.75 J",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Here, we are given the mass of nitrogen and its molecular mass. The mass is 2 x 10^-2 kg or 20 g and the molecular mass is 28 g/mol. The given mass in g's helps us to easily use it later to calculate the number of moles. Step 2) The next step is to calculate the number of moles (n) from the known values of mass and molecular mass. We use the formula n = mass / molecular mass (w/m) which is n = 20 g / 28 g/mol, which simplifies to n = 0.714 moles (with rounding to three decimal places). Step 3) We are told that nitrogen is a diatomic molecule so the heat capacity at constant pressure (C), is given by C = 7R / 2, where R = 8.3 J mol^-1 K^-1. This gives us the value for C as 29.05 J mol^-1 K^-1 (after rounding). Step 4) We are asked to calculate the amount of heat Q, needed to raise the temperature of the nitrogen by 45 C or 45 K (since increments in Celsius and Kelvin are equal). We use the formula Q = nCT, plug in our previously calculated values and simplify. This gives Q = (0.714 moles * 29.05 J mol^-1 K^-1 * 45 K) which equals 933.75 Joules.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Given the mass of nitrogen in kg converted to grams and the molecular mass in g/mol, we're set-up to calculate the number of moles. Step 2) Use the formula for calculating number of moles (n = w / m) where w = mass and m = molecular mass. This gives the quantity of nitrogen in terms of moles. Step 3) Nitrogen is a diatomic molecule, so we use a specific formula for such molecules to calculate C, the heat capacity at constant pressure (C = 7R / 2). Step 4) Now, we use all the obtained values in the heat equation Q = nCT to determine the heat needed to increase the temperature by 45\u00b0C. This equation gives us the desired heat required to raise the temperature of nitrogen, Q in Joules."
