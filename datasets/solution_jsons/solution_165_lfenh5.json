    "Question": "Q12. Compute the bulk modulus of water from the following data: Initial volume = 100.0 litres, Pressure increase = 100.0 atm (1 atm = 1.013 \u00d7 10^5 Pa), Final volume = 100.5 litres. Compare the bulk modulus of water with that of air (at constant temperature). Explain in simple terms why the ratio is so large.",
    "Original Solution": "Initial volume, V1 =100.0 litre =100.0\u00d710^\u22123 m^3\r\nFinal volume, V2 =100.5 litre =100.5\u00d710^\u22123 m^3\r\nChange in the volume, \u0394V=V2 \u2212V1 =0.5\u00d710^\u22123 m^3\r\nPressure increase, p=100.0atm=100\u00d71.013\u00d710^5Pa\r\n= 101.3 x 10^5Pa\r\nBulk modulus of water= p/(\u0394V/V1)=pV1/\u0394V\r\n= 101.3\u00d710^5\u00d7100\u00d710^(\u22123)/(0.5\u00d710^\u22123)\r\n= 2.026\u00d710^9 Pa\r\nBulk modulus of air = 1\u00d710^5 Pa\r\nBulk modulus of water / Bulk modulus of air = 2.026\u00d710^9/(1\u00d710^5)\r\n=2.026\u00d710^4\r\nThe intermolecular force in liquids is much larger than in air as the distance between the molecules is much lesser in liquid than in air. Therefore, at the same temperature, the strain for water is much more than for air.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the provided data. Initial volume (V1) is given as 100.0 liters, Final volume (V2) is given as 100.5 litres, and the increase in pressure is specified as 100.0 atm. Note that 1 atm is equivalent to 1.013 \u00d7 10^5 Pa, so we can use this for our calculations. \nStep 2) Convert the given volumes from litres to cubic meters, as this is typically the standard SI unit used in physics calculations. For this, we multiply by 10^\u22123, transforming 100.0 liters to 100.0 \u00d7 10^\u22123 m^3 and 100.5 liters to 100.5 \u00d7 10^\u22123 m^3.\nStep 3) Calculate the change in volume (\u2206V) by subtracting the initial volume (V1) from the final volume (V2). Thus, \u2206V = V2 - V1 = 0.5 \u00d7 10^\u22123 m^3.\nStep 4) Convert the given pressure increase from atm to Pascal (Pa) by multiplying by 1.013 \u00d7 10^5. This gives us a pressure increase (p) of 100 \u00d7 1.013 \u00d7 10^5 Pa = 101.3 x 10^5 Pa.\nStep 5) Apply the formula for the Bulk Modulus of water, which is defined as the pressure divided by the fractional volume change. Hence, the Bulk modulus, B = p / (\u2206V / V1) = pV1 / \u2206V.\nStep 6) Input these calculations to find the bulk modulus, B, of water. B = 101.3 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 10^\u22123 / (0.5 \u00d7 10^\u22123) = 2.026 \u00d7 10^9 Pa.\nStep 7) As provided, the Bulk modulus of air is 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa. Now, compute the ratio of the bulk modulus of water to the bulk modulus of air. B_water / B_air = 2.026 \u00d7 10^9 / 1 \u00d7 10^5 = 2.026 \u00d7 10^4.\nStep 8) Finally, analyze the results in the context of the properties of matter. The reason for this large ratio is that the intermolecular forces in water atoms are stronger due to the smaller distance between the molecules as compared to air. Thus, at the same temperature, a change in volume (strain) affects water more than it affects air.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Establish the provided data in appropriate units, with pressure and volumes in pascals and cubic meters respectively. Step 2) Compute the change in volume (\u2206V) by subtracting the initial from the final volume. Step 3) Convert the increased pressure from atm to Pa. Step 4) Use the formula for Bulk modulus, B = p / (\u2206V / V1), where 'p' is the pressure and V1 is the initial volume. Step 5) Substitute the values into this equation to find the bulk modulus of water. Step 6) Compute the ratio of the bulk modulus of water to that of air. Step 7) Conclude that the large ratio is a consequence of the stronger intermolecular forces in water compared to air, and the reduced intervening distance between water molecules."
