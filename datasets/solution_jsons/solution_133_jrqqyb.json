    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, let's note down the information we have from the problem. The radius of the solid disc and the ring (r) is 10 cm or 0.10 m, the initial angular speed (\u03c90) is 10 \u03c0 rad s\u20131, and the coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bck) is 0.2. \n\nStep 2) The movement of these objects is caused by the force of friction. From Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion, we know that force equals mass times acceleration (f = ma). Since the force here is friction, we write it as \u03bckmg = ma. \n\nStep 3) If we rearrange the equation to solve for the acceleration (a), we have a = \u03bckg, where 'm' represents the mass and 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity. \n\nStep 4) Now, we refer to the first equation of motion - v = u + at - where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity and at is the product of acceleration and time. In our scenario, the initial velocity u is 0 (the objects are initially at rest), hence we can simplify the equation to v = \u03bckgt.\n\nStep 5) The frictional force applies torque in a perpendicularly outward direction, reducing the initial angular speed. We depict this with the equation - Torque (T) = \u2212I\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the Angular acceleration and 'I' represents rotational inertia.\n\nStep 6) By rearranging the above formula, we find that angular acceleration \u03b1 = -\u03bckmgr / I.\n\nStep 7) Applying the first equation of rotational motion, \u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03b1t, we substitute \u03b1 in terms of -\u03bckmgr / I from the step above, obtaining \u03c9 =  \u03c90 + (-\u03bckmgr / I )t\n\nStep 8) Rolling starts when the linear velocity equals the product of radius and angular velocity - v = r\u03c9. Plugging in \u03c9 from the previous step, we get v = r(\u03c90 - \u03bckmgrt / I). \n\nStep 9) Equating v from step 4 and step 8, and simplifying the resulting equation, we get: \u03bckgt = r\u03c90 - \u03bckmgr^2t / I .\n\nStep 10) To find out when does each object start rolling, we need to substitute I for each object and solve for 't'. For the ring, I = mr^2 and hence the time it would start rolling (tR) = r\u03c90 / 2\u03bckg = ( 0.1 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3.14) / (2 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 10 ) = 0.80 s.\n\nStep 11) For the disc, the moment of inertia (I) is different, I = (1/2)mr^2. Hence the time it would start rolling (tD) = r\u03c90 / 3\u03bckg = ( 0.1 x 10 \u00d7 3.14) / (3 \u00d7 0.2 \u00d7 9.8 ) = 0.53 s.\n\nStep 12) Comparing the times, we see that tD < tR, implying that the disc will start to roll earlier than the ring.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin by noting down the given values from the problem - radius, initial angular speed and the coefficient of kinetic friction.\n\nStep 2) Understand that the motion of these objects is due to the force of friction, which according to Newton\u2019s Second Law of motion gives us \u03bckmg = ma.\n\nStep 3) Re-arrange to get to the acceleration, a = \u03bckg.\n\nStep 4) Use the first equation of motion to determine the relation v = \u03bckgt.\n\nStep 5) Realize that the frictional force lowers the initial angular speed, depicted by T = \u2013I\u03b1.\n\nStep 6) Solving for angular acceleration, we get \u03b1 = -\u03bckmgr / I.\n\nStep 7) Use the first equation of rotational motion and replace \u03b1 in terms of other variables to obtain \u03c9 = \u03c90 + (-\u03bckmgr / I )t.\n\nStep 8) Ascertain that rolling starts when linear velocity equals radius times angular velocity, substituting \u03c9 from the above step.\n\nStep 9) Equate the two expressions of v to establish one equation in terms of t: \u03bckgt = r\u03c90 - \u03bckmgr^2t / I.\n\nStep 10) Substitute the moment of inertia for each object into the equation from step 9 to solve for 't' for each object.\n\nStep 11) Based on the 't' values, conclude that the disc will start to roll before the ring as it has a lesser 't'."
