    "Question": "6. Estimate the total number of air molecules (inclusive of oxygen, nitrogen, water vapour and other constituents) in a room of capacity 25.0 m^3 at a temperature of 27 C and 1 atm pressure.",
    "Original Solution": "The volume of the room, V = 25.0 m^3\r\nThe temperature of the room, T = 270 C = 300 K\r\nThe pressure in the room, P = 1 atm = 1.013 x 10^5 Pa\r\nThe ideal gas equation relating pressure (P), Volume (V), and absolute temperature (T) can be written as\r\nPV = (kBNT)\r\nWhere,\r\nKB is Boltzmann constant = (1.38 x 10^(-23)) m^2 kg s^-2 K^-1\r\nN is the number of air molecules in the room.\r\nTherefore,\r\nN = (PV / kBT)\r\n= (1.013 x 10^5 x 25) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) x 300)\r\nWe get,\r\n= 6.11 x 10^26 molecules\r\nHence, the total number of air molecules in the given room is 6.11 x 10^26",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by identifying the provided variables in the problem: the volume of the room (V) is 25.0 m^3, the temperature of the room (T) is 27 degrees Celsius which we must convert to Kelvin by adding 273 to it giving us 300 K. The pressure in the room (P) is 1 atm which is equivalent to 1.013 x 10^5 Pa when converted from atm to Pa. Step 2) We employ the ideal gas equation that relates pressure (P), volume (V), and absolute temperature (T). This equation is PV = (kBNT), where kB stands for Boltzmann's constant which has a value of 1.38 x 10^(-23) m^2 kg s^-2 K^-1 and N is the number of air molecules present in the room. This equation is the key to solving our problem. Step 3) Our goal is to find N, which can be done by isolating it on one side of the equation. We achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by (kB * T), resulting in N = PV / (kBT). Step 4) We now substitute the known values into this equation, specifically P = 1.013 x 10^5 Pa, V = 25.0 m^3, kB = 1.38 x 10^(-23) m^2 kg s^-2 K^-1 and T = 300 K. Performing the calculation (1.013 x 10^5 x 25) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) x 300) gives us approximately 6.11 x 10^26. Thus, the total number of air molecules in the given room is estimated to be about 6.11 x 10^26.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Note the given values of volume (V), temperature (T), and pressure (P), and perform necessary conversions to broadly accepted units. So, P is converted to Pa and T is converted to K. Step 2) Apply the ideal gas equation PV = (kBNT) which connects all the relevant quantities, where kB is Boltzmann's constant and N is the number of air molecules. Step 3) Isolate N by dividing both sides of the equation by (kB * T) forming N = PV / (kBT). Step 4) Finally, use the known values to calculate N, resulting in an estimate of the total number of air molecules in the room."
