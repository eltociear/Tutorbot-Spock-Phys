    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we start with the known values: the mass of the automobile (3000 kg), the suspension sag (15 cm), and the decrease in amplitude (50%) during one complete oscillation. Step 2) We want to find the spring constant (k) of each spring. Given that the car is supported by four springs, the total force is evenly distributed among them (providing each spring holds the same load). We express this as K=4k, where K is the total spring constant. Step 3) Using the equation F=mg, we arrive at Mg=4kx. Here, F is the weight of the car, M is its mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and x is the displacement (sag). Step 4) Rearranging the equation to solve for k, we have k = Mg/4x = (3000 x 10)/(4 x 0.15) = 5 x 10^4 N. This gives us the spring constant for one spring. Step 5) It's stated that each wheel supports 750 kg. Using the natural frequency formula for a harmonic oscillator t = 2\u03c0\u221am/\u221ak = 2 x 3.14 x (\u221a750/\u221a5 x 10^4) = 0.77 sec, we get the time period of one oscillation. Step 6) Using the decay of amplitude formula (x = x0e^(-bt/2m)), we can find the damping constant b. From the problem, we know that the amplitude decreases to half its original value after one time period. This leads to 50% of x0 = x0e^(-b*0.77/2*750). Step 7) By simplifying and using the natural logarithm, we can solve for b. We equate log_e2 to (b*0.77)/(1500)log_ee. Step 8) Solving for b gives b = (1500*log_e2) / 0.77 = 1350.2 kg/s. This is the damping constant of the shock absorber.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values: automobile mass, suspension sag, and amplitude decrease. Step 2) Define the total spring constant as K=4k. Step 3) Use the force equation (F=mg) for the car on the spring to relate the forces: Mg=4kx. Step 4) Solve for the spring constant k. Step 5) Apply the natural frequency of a harmonic oscillator formula to find the time period of one oscillation. Step 6) Utilize the decay of amplitude formula (related to damping in a oscillatory system) to define an equation for the damping constant b. Step 7) Use logarithmic identities to simplify this equation. Step 8) Solve for the damping constant b. The steps guide through the process of determining an oscillatory system's spring and damping constants based on physical observations and the system's behavior (amplitude decay)."
