    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start with identifying the given values: the temperature at the triple point of water, T0 = 273.16 K, the resistance at the triple point of water, R0 = 101.6 \u03a9, the temperature at the normal melting point of lead, T1 = 600.5 K and the resistance at the normal melting point of lead, R1 =165.5 \u03a9. These are constants in our problem. Step 2) Understand that we are trying to find the coefficient of proportionality, \u03b1, using the formula R = Ro[1 + \u03b1(T \u2013 To )] which informs us how the resistance changes with temperature. Step 3) Substitute the values of R1, Ro, T1, To and \u03b1 into the formula to get: 165.5 = 101.6 [1+\u03b1(600.5 \u2013 273.16)], which simplifies to 165.5 = 101.6 + \u03b1(101.6) * 327.34. Step 4) Solve for the unknown variable, \u03b1, by isolating it on one side of the equation: \u03b1 = (165.5 \u2013 101.6) / (101.6 * 327.34). After performing the arithmetic operations, we find \u03b1 to be approximately 0.00199. Step 5) Now, we wish to find the temperature when the resistance is 123.4 \u03a9. Plug the known values of \u03b1, the resistance R2 = 123.4 \u03a9, and the previously found values of T0 and R0 into the formula: 123.4 = 101.6 [1 + (0.00199)(T2 \u2013 273.16)]. Simplify to find T2 = (123.4 - 101.6 + 0.195 * 273.16) /  0.195 = 385.23 K. So, the temperature (T2) when the resistance (R2) reaches 123.4 \u03a9 is approximately 385.23 K.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify your known values: the temperature and resistance at the triple point of water and the normal melting point of lead. Step 2) Understand you are solving for the coefficient of proportionality, \u03b1, using the resistance formula, to calculate how resistance varies with temperature. Step 3) Use the known values to form an equation using the resistance formula. Step 4) Isolate unknown variable \u03b1 and perform arithmetic operations to find its value. Step 5) With \u03b1 known, use the resistance formula again, along with the known resistance to find the unknown temperature value. Essentially, the steps connect through the resistance formula; first, to find the coefficient of proportionality, and later, to find the unknown temperature."
