    "Question": "26: (a) What is the largest average velocity of blood flow in an artery of radius 2\u00d710^\u20133m if the flow must remain laminar? (b) What is the corresponding flow rate? (Take the viscosity of blood to be 2.084 \u00d7 10^\u20133 Pa s)",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nRadius of the vein, r = 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m\r\nDiameter of the vein, d = 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^-3 m = 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m\r\nViscosity of blood ,\u03b7 = 2.08 x 10^(-3) m  Density of blood, \u03c1 = 1.06 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3\r\n(a) We know Reynolds\u2019 number for laminar flow, NR = 2000\r\nTherefore, the greatest  average velocity of blood is\r\nVAVG= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ N_{ R }\\eta }{ \\rho d }\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 2000 \\times 2.084 \\times 10^{-3} }{ 1.06 \\times 10^{ 3 } \\times 4 \\times 10^{ -3 }} \\end{array} \\)\r\n= 0.983m/s\r\n(b) And, flow rate R = VAVG \u03c0 r2 = 0.983 x 3.14 x ( 10^-3)^2= 1.235 x 10^-6 m^3/s",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start with the known values given in the problem. The radius of the vein, r, is 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m. The viscosity of blood, \u03b7, is 2.084 \u00d7 10^-3 Pa s. Note that the density of blood, \u03c1, which we might need, is 1.06 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3. \\nStep 2) Knowing that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow happens around a Reynolds\u2019 number, NR, of 2000, we can use this as the value of the Reynolds' number in our subsequent calculations. \\nStep 3) The equation for the greatest average velocity of blood VAVG, given a Reynolds' number, viscosity, blood density and diameter, is VAVG= NR*\u03b7 / (\u03c1*d). We'll use this to calculate the highest speed the blood flow can have before it becomes turbulent. \\nStep 4) Use the given diameter of the vein, d = 2*r = 2*2 \u00d7 10^-3 m = 4 \u00d7 10^-3 m. \\nStep 5) Substitute the known values into the equation: VAVG = 2000 * 2.084 * 10^-3 / (1.06 * 10^3 * 4 * 10^-3) = 0.983 m/s. So the maximum average velocity for laminar flow in an artery of this size carrying blood of this viscosity is approximately 0.983 m/s. \\nStep 6) Now, to find the flow rate, we will use the equation R = VAVG * \u03c0 * r^2. This describes how much fluid flows per unit time (flow rate), given its velocity and the cross-sectional area of the location where it's flowing (a circle of radius r). \\nStep 7) Substituting the known values into the equation, the flow rate R = 0.983 * 3.14 * (2 \u00d7 10^-3)^2 = 1.235 x 10^-6 m^3/s. This is the maximum flow rate under laminar conditions for the artery.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values from the problem: the radius of the vein r, the viscosity of the blood \u03b7, and the Reynolds' number NR for the laminar-turbulent transition. \\nStep 2) Recall the equation VAVG = NR*\u03b7 / (\u03c1*d) to calculate the greatest average velocity of blood before the flow becomes turbulent. \\nStep 3) Calculate the diameter of the vein, d, as twice the radius. \\nStep 4) Plug the known values into the velocity equation to get VAVG = 0.983 m/s. \\nStep 5) Use the equation for flow rate, R = VAVG * \u03c0 * r^2, which expresses the volume of fluid flowing per unit time in terms of the flow's speed and the cross-sectional area of its path. \\nStep 6) Plug the known values into the flow rate equation to get R = 1.235 x 10^-6 m^3/s. The flow rate under laminar conditions in the artery is thus about 1.235 x 10^-6 cubic meters per second."
