    "Question": "2.12 The mass of a box measured by a grocer\u2019s balance is 2.30 kg. Two gold pieces of masses 20.15 g and 20.17 g are added to the box. What is\r\n(a) the total mass of the box,\r\n(b) the difference in the masses of the pieces to correct significant figures? ",
    "Original Solution": "The mass of the box = 2.30 kg\r\nand the mass of the first gold piece = 20.15 g\r\nThe mass of the second gold piece = 20.17 g\r\nThe total mass = 2.300 + 0.2015 + 0.2017 = 2.7032 kg\r\nSince 1 is the least number of decimal places, the total mass = 2.7 kg.\r\nThe mass difference = 20.17 \u2013 20.15 = 0.02 g\r\nSince 2 is the least number of decimal places, the total mass = 0.02 g.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The information provided in the problem is as follows: the mass of the box is 2.30 kg, and the masses of the two gold pieces are 20.15 g and 20.17 g. However, the gold pieces' weights are in grams, while the box's weight is in kilograms. We need to have all the weights in the same unit to perform our operations. \nStep 2) Therefore, the next step is to convert the weights of the gold pieces from grams to kilograms. We do this by dividing each gold piece's mass by 1000 because 1 kg = 1000 g. This gives us 0.2015 kg and 0.2017 kg for the first and second gold pieces, respectively. \nStep 3) To find the total mass of the box with the gold pieces inside (part a), we add the masses of the box and the two gold pieces together. Therefore, the total mass equals 2.300 kg + 0.2015 kg + 0.2017 kg = 2.7032 kg.\nStep 4) To present our answer with the correct number of significant figures, we must consider the least accurate number in our calculation, which had 1 decimal place (the mass of the box, 2.3 kg). Therefore, we round our total to one decimal place, getting 2.7 kg as the total mass of the box with the gold pieces inside. \nStep 5) For the difference in the masses of the gold pieces (part b), we subtract 20.15 g from 20.17 g to get 0.02 g. This is less significant in this case, because the masses were nearly identical, and their difference is very minute.\nStep 6) Again, we wish to present this difference with the correct number of significant figures, so we stick with our original two decimal places as in the measurements of the gold pieces, giving a final weight difference of 0.02 g.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We start with the given data: 2.30 kg for the box's mass and 20.15 g and 20.17 g for the gold pieces' masses. The gold pieces' weights need to be in the same unit as the box's weight to make the calculation possible. \nStep 2) We convert the mass of each gold piece from grams to kilograms by dividing by 1000.\nStep 3) Next, to calculate the total mass (part a), we add the weights of the box and the two gold pieces together.\nStep 4) The total weight value is then rounded to the correct number of significant figures based on the least precise measurement from our data.\nStep 5) To find the difference in the masses of the gold pieces (part b), we simply subtract one from the other.\nStep 6) Finally, the difference in weight is expressed with the correct number of significant figures, matching those of the gold piece measurements."
