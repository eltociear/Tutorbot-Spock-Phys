    "Question": "27. A bolt of mass 0.3 kg falls from the ceiling of an elevator moving down with a uniform speed of 7 ms^-1. It hits the floor of the elevator (length of elevator = 3 m) and does not rebound. What is the heat produced by the impact? Would your answer be different if the elevator were stationary?\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Mass of the bolt, m = 0.3 kg\r\nPotential energy of the bolt = mgh = 0.3 x 9.8 x 3 = 8.82 J\r\nThe bolt does not rebound. So, the whole of the potential energy gets converted to heat energy. The heat produced will remain the same even if the lift is stationary since the value of acceleration due to gravity is the same in all inertial systems.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) To begin solving, we note the known facts. The mass of the bolt, denoted by 'm', is 0.3 kg. The bolt falls from a height (h) of 3 meters which corresponds to the length of the elevator. \\n Step 2) We express the potential energy of the bolt. In physics, potential energy of an object in relation to height can be calculated using the formula Potential Energy = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational constant on Earth (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height from which the object fell. For this problem, we input the known values into the formula to calculate: 0.3 kg * 9.8 ms^-2 * 3 meters = 8.82 J. The calculated potential energy, 8.82 Joules, is how much energy the bolt possessed due to its height. \\n Step 3) Now we reason out the fact that the bolt does not rebound or bounce back up. This means all of the potential energy it had, due to its height, was converted into heat energy when it hit the floor. The heat produced from this energy conversion is thus equal to the calculated potential energy, 8.82 Joules. \\n Step 4) The last part of the problem is a conceptual question asking if our result would differ if the elevator was not moving. Since the acceleration due to gravity remains constant regardless of whether the elevator is stationary or moving (assuming the elevator is an inertial system), the potential energy of the bolt (and hence the heat produced when it hits the floor) would remain the same. In other words, the motion of the elevator does not affect our calculation.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Start with identifying the given information, which includes the mass (m = 0.3 kg) of the bolt and the height (h = 3 m) from which it falls. \\n Step 2) Using the formula for potential energy (Potential Energy = mgh), fill in the given data and solve to find the potential energy of the bolt. \\n Step 3) Understand that the bolt's lack of rebound signifies all potential energy was converted into heat energy upon impact, calculating the heat energy produced. \\n Step 4) Evaluate the situation conceptually; the heat energy would remain the same if the elevator was stationary, since the acceleration due to gravity remains constant in all inertial systems."
