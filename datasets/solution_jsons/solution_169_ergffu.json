    "Question": "Q16.How much should the pressure on a litre of water be changed to compress it by 0.10%? ",
    "Original Solution": "Volume of water, V=1 litre\r\nWater should be compressed by 0.10%\r\nThe fractional change in volume, \u25b3V/V=(0.1/100)\u00d71=10^(\u22123)\r\nBulk modulus, B =P/(\u25b3V/V) = PV/\u25b3V\r\nP=B\u00d7(\u25b3V/V)\r\nBulk modulus of water, B = 2.2\u00d710^9 Nm^\u22122\r\nPressure on water, P=2.2\u00d710^9 \u00d710^\u22123 =2.2\u00d710^6 Pa",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Note down the provided information and establish the known parameters. We know that the volume of water, V=1 litre, and that it should be compressed by 0.10%. In this context, 'compressing' means decreasing the volume, and we are dealing with a physical change that will require force or pressure to achieve. So our goal is to find the pressure needed to create this physical change. Step 2) Next, let's determine the fractional change in volume, denoted as \u25b3V/V. This is computed by the percentage divided by 100. In our case, that's (0.1/100)\u00d71, which equals to 0.001 or 10^(-3). The fractional change represents the desired decrease in volume in relation to the original volume. Step 3) Now, let's recap the concept of Bulk modulus, B. This is a material property defined as the ratio of pressure (p) to the fractional volume change (\u25b3V/V). The formula for this is B = P/(\u25b3V/V) or rearranged it becomes P = B\u00d7(\u25b3V/V). This will be useful for finding the pressure in the following steps. Step 4) Use the known Bulk modulus of water, which is B = 2.2\u00d710^9 Nm^\u22122. This value is experimentally determined and commonly used. The units Nm^\u22122 are the same as Pascals, Pa, the unit we'll use for the pressure. Step 5) Lastly, plug the values into the formula determined in step 3: P = B\u00d7(\u25b3V/V). This means that the pressure on water required to achieve the volume reduction is P=2.2\u00d710^9 \u00d710^\u22123 = 2.2\u00d710^6 Pa.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known quantities which are the volume and the percent compression. Step 2) Compute the fractional volume change, \u25b3V/V, using the given percentage compression. Step 3) Recall the concept of Bulk Modulus and its formula B = P/(\u25b3V/V). Step 4) Use the known standard value of Bulk modulus for water to calculate pressure using P = B\u00d7(\u25b3V/V). Step 5) The calculated pressure is the answer to the problem. It will be the amount of pressure needed to compress the given volume by the specified percentage."
