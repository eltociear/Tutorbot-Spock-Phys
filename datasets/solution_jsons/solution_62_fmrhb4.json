    "Question": "Q31.  A cyclist is riding with a speed of 27 km/h. As he approaches a circular turn on the road of a radius of 80 m, he applies brakes and reduces his speed at the constant rate of 0.50 m/s every second. What is the magnitude and direction of the net acceleration of the cyclist on the circular turn?\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Speed of the cyclist = 27 km/h = 27 x (5/18) = 7.5 m/s\r\nThe radius of the road = 80 m\r\nThe net acceleration is due to the braking and the centripetal acceleration.\r\nDue to braking, a =  0.50 m/s^2\r\nCentripetal acceleration, a = v2/2 = (7.5)2/80 = 0.70 m/s^2\r\nSince the angle between ac and aT is 90o, the resultant acceleration is given by\r\n= 0.86 m/s^2\r\nand tan \u03b2 = ac/at = 0.7/0.5 = 1.4\r\n\u03b2 = tan^(-1) (1.4) = 54.50 from the direction of velocity",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem states that the initial speed of the cyclist is 27 km/h. Since we need the speed in m/s for our calculations, we convert this value by using a conversion factor of 5/18. This gives us 27 x (5/18) = 7.5 m/s. Step 2) The problem also provides us with the radius of the circular turn, 80 m. Step 3) On this circular turn, the cyclist experiences two types of acceleration: 'due to braking' and 'centripetal acceleration'. These two accelerations happen simultaneously and are orthogonal to each other. Thus, they yield a net acceleration on the cyclist. Step 4) The provide that 'due to braking', the speed of the cyclist is reduced at a constant rate of 0.50 m/s each second. This constant rate of speed reduction is the acceleration due to braking, a = 0.50 m/s^2. Step 5) To calculate the 'centripetal acceleration', we apply the physics formula v^2/r, where v is the speed of the cyclist and r is the radius of the turn. This gives us (7.5)^2 / 80 = 0.70 m/s^2. Step 6) To calculate the 'net acceleration', we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the net acceleration (resultant) is equal to the square of the acceleration due to braking plus the square of the centripetal acceleration. The net acceleration works out to be the square root of (0.50^2 + 0.70^2) = 0.86 m/s^2. Step 7) It's also mentioned in the problem to find the direction of the net acceleration. For this, we use the relationship tan \u03b2 = a_c/a_t, where '\u03b2' is the angle made by the resultant acceleration with the direction of initial velocity, 'a_c' is centripetal acceleration and 'a_t' is acceleration due to braking. On solving, we get tan \u03b2 = 0.7/0.5 = 1.4, which is equivalent to \u03b2 = tan^(-1)(1.4) = 54.50 degrees.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert the speed of the cyclist from km/h to m/s using the appropriate factor. Step 2) Acknowledge the provided radius of the circular turn. Step 3) Understand that the cyclist experiences both 'braking' and 'centripetal' accelerations. Step 4) Use the given speed reduction rate to calculate the braking acceleration. Step 5) Apply the formula 'v^2/r' to calculate the centripetal acceleration. Step 6) Use Pythagorean theorem to calculate the net acceleration. Step 7) Use the relationship 'tan \u03b2 = a_c/a_t' to find the direction of the net acceleration."
