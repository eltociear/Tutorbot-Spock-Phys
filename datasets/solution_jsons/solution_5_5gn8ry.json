    "Question": "2.7. A student measures the thickness of a human hair by looking at it through amicroscope of magnification 100. He makes 20 observations and finds that the average width of the hair in the field of view of the microscope is 3.5 mm. What is the estimate on the thickness of the hair?",
    "Original Solution": "The average width of the hair in the field of view of the microscope = 3.5 mm\r\nActual thickness of hair =3.5 mm/100 = 0.035 mm",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start off by identifying the known values. In this problem, we know that the average width of the hair, as viewed under the microscope, is 3.5mm. We also know that the microscope is giving us an image that's magnified by a factor of 100. This means the hair we're looking at is 100 times larger than it is in reality. Step 2) To determine the actual thickness of the hair, we need to perform a division operation. Our equation is: 'Actual thickness = Apparent thickness / Magnification'. The 'Apparent thickness' here is the 3.5mm we measured under the microscope. The 'Magnification' is 100, which is our magnification factor. Step 3) So, if we plug our known values into the equation, we have 'Actual thickness = 3.5mm / 100'. This gives us a result of 0.035mm, which is the actual thickness of the hair. Since the thickness was exaggerated by the microscope, we expect that the actual thickness to be much smaller- exactly what we obtained.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the known values of the problem- The average width of the hair under the microscope (3.5mm) and the magnification factor of the microscope (100 times). Step 2) Use the equation 'Actual thickness = Apparent thickness / Magnification' to find out the actual thickness of the hair. This equation is obtained from the basic principle that magnification equals the apparent size (observed size under the microscope) divided by the actual size. Rearranging this gives us the equation we are using. Step 3) Substitute the known values into the equation to obtain the actual thickness of the hair, which turns out to be 0.035mm."
