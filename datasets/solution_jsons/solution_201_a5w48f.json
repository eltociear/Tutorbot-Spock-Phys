    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we identify the known variables. We know that both the brass and steel rod are the same length and diameter, 50 cm and 3 mm respectively. The initial temperature (T1) is 40\u00b0C and the final temperature (T2) is 250\u00b0C. We're given the co-efficient of linear expansion of brass as 2.0 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1) and for steel it's 1.2 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1). \n\nStep 2) Now, the increase in temperature, (\u2206T), is calculated by subtracting T1 from T2. \u2206T = T2 \u2013 T1, thus \u2206T = 250 \u2013 40, resulting in \u2206T =210\u00b0C.\n\nStep 3) We are looking for the change in lengths of both rods, so we must solve it separately for each rod. Starting with the brass rod, we use its co-efficient of linear expansion and apply it to the formula L1 = L0(1 + \u221d\u2206T). So L1 = 50(1 + 2 \u00d7 10^(-5)\u00d7210) = 50(1 + 420 \u00d7 10^(-5)) = 50\u00d7 1.00420 = 50.21 cm.\n\nStep 4) Now the increase in length of this brass rod is calculated by taking away the initial length from the final length. Increase in length of brass ( \u2206L) = L1 \u2013 L0, which results in \u2206L = 50.21 \u2013 50, giving us \u2206L = 0.21 cm.\n\nStep 5) We follow a similar procedure for the steel rod. We use its co-efficient of linear expansion in the formula L2= L0(1 + \u03b2\u2206T). Thus, L2 = 50(1 + 1.2 \u00d7 10^(-5)\u00d7210) = 50 \u00d7 1.00252 = 50.126 cm.\n\nStep 6) Similarly, we calculate the increase in length of this steel rod. Increase in length ( \u2206L\u2019) = L2 \u2013 L0, which gives us \u2206L\u2019 = 50.126 cm \u2013 50 cm = 0.126 cm.\n\nStep 7) Finally, we add the increases in lengths of both rods to get the total increase in length = \u2206L + \u2206L\u2019 = 0.21 + 0.126 = 0.336 cm.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify all known variables and coefficients. In this case, it includes the lengths, diameters, initial and final temperatures, and co-efficient of linear expansion for both rods.\n\nStep 2) Calculate the change in temperature, \u2206T, by subtracting the initial temperature from the final temperature.\n\nStep 3) Calculate the final length of the brass rod using its co-efficient of linear expansion and the formula for thermal expansion.\n\nStep 4) Calculate the increase in the length of the brass rod itself by subtracting the original length from the final length.\n\nStep 5) Using a similar process as step 3, calculate the final length of the steel rod.\n\nStep 6) Calculate the increase in the length of the steel rod by subtracting the original length from the final length.\n\nStep 7) Lastly, to get the total change in length of the combined rod, add the increases in lengths of both rods together."
