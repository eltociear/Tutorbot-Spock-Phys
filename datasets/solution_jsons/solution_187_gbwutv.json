    "Question": "25: In deriving Bernoulli\u2019s equation, we equated the work done on the fluid in the tube to its change in the potential and kinetic energy. (a) What is the largest average velocity of blood flow in an artery of diameter 2 \u00d7 10^\u20133 m if the flow must remain laminar? (b) Do the dissipative forces become more important as the fluid velocity increases? Discuss qualitatively.",
    "Original Solution": "(a) If dissipative forces are present, then some forces in liquid flow due to pressure difference is spent against dissipative forces, due to which the pressure drop becomes large.\r\n(b) The dissipative forces become more important with increasing flow velocity because of turbulence.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, we analyze the problem and consider the given values. The diameter of the artery is given as 2 \u00d7 10^\u20133 m, and we are asked to determine the largest average velocity of blood flow in the artery. Even though no further numbers are given, our problem is implying that there is a relationship between the diameter of an artery and its maximum average blood velocity for laminar flow. Step 2) When dealing with fluid dynamics, it is crucial to understand the properties of the fluid and the type of flow - in this case, the fluid is blood and the flow is assumed to be laminar. When the flow is laminar, it means it's 'smooth', without cross-currents or turbulence. However, as the velocity of the blood flow increases, the forces against the laminar flow (dissipative forces) also increase, which may cause the flow to become turbulent. Step 3) This leads to the realization that the largest average velocity for blood flow will be the velocity right before the blood flow becomes turbulent from the increasing dissipative forces. Step 4) To answer the second part of the problem, we think about what happens when the velocity increases even more. As the velocity further increases, the flow becomes turbulent and dissipative forces overcome the pressure differences driving the flow. Therefore, yes, the dissipative forces do become more important as the fluid velocity increases. This is due to the nature of turbulence, which is chaotic and full of cross-currents and eddies, leading to much higher resistance against the flow.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We begin by setting up the problem, noting the given diameter of the artery and the requirement to find the maximum average velocity for blood flow under laminar conditions. Step 2) We discuss the properties of fluid flow, focusing on the definition of laminar flow and how it relates to the properties of blood as a fluid. Step 3) This leads us to the concept that our maximum average velocity would be the velocity right before the flow switches from laminar to turbulent due to increasing dissipative forces. Step 4) To answer the second part of the problem, we discuss the impact of increased velocity, which strengthens the dissipative forces and leads to a transition into turbulent flow. This demonstrates that dissipative forces indeed become more important as fluid velocity increases."
