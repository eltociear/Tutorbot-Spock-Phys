    "Question": "Q13. Provide clear explanations and examples to distinguish between:\r\n(a) The total length of a path covered by a particle and the magnitude of displacement over the same interval of time.\r\n(b) The magnitude of average velocity over an interval of time, and the average speed over the same interval. [Average speed of a particle over an interval of time is defined as the total path length divided by the time interval]. \r\nIn (a) and (b), compare and find which of the two quantities is greater.\r\nWhen can the given quantities be equal? [For simplicity, consider one-dimensional motion only].",
    "Original Solution": "( a ) Let us consider an example of a football; it is passed to player B by player A and then instantly kicked back to player A along the same path. Now, the magnitude of displacement of the ball is 0 because it has returned to its initial position. However, the total length of the path covered by the ball = AB +BA = 2AB. Hence, it is clear that the first quantity is greater than the second.\r\n( b ) Taking the above example, let us assume that football takes t seconds to cover the total distance. Then,\r\nThe magnitude of the average velocity of the ball over time interval t = Magnitude of displacement/time interval\r\n= 0 / t = 0.\r\nThe average speed of the ball over the same interval = total length of the path/time interval\r\n= 2AB/t\r\nThus, the second quantity is greater than the first.\r\nThe above quantities are equal if the ball moves only in one direction from one player to another (considering one-dimensional motion).",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem begins by asking to distinguish between the total length of the path covered by an object and the magnitude of the object's displacement over the same time interval. To exemplify this, we imagine a football being passed between two players. Step 2) Displacement is defined as the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point, along with its direction. In this case, the ball is passed to Player B and immediately returned to Player A. It returns to its original position, resulting in a displacement of zero. Step 3) Meanwhile, the total length of the path is calculated as the distance covered by the ball from Player A to B, and then from Player B back to A, giving us a total of 2AB. Therefore, in this context, we see that the total length of the path is greater than the displacement. Step 4) Next, we need to distinguish between the magnitude of average velocity and average speed over the same time interval. Suppose the ball takes 't' seconds to cover the total distance. In the case of average velocity, it's computed as the magnitude of displacement divided by the time interval. Considering that our displacement is zero, the average velocity in our case also results in zero. Step 5) On the other hand, the average speed is computed as the total path length divided by the time interval, which gives us 2AB/t. This means the average speed is greater than the average velocity in this example. Step 6) The two quantities - total length of the path and displacement, or average speed and average velocity - can only be equal if the ball moves only in one direction, that is, from one player to another in a straight path. This equality is possible only in one-dimensional motion, as specified in the problem.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We look at a football scenario involving two players to illustrate the concept of path length and displacement. Step 2) Given the ball is passed back to its original position, its displacement (straight-line distance from start to finish) is zero. Step 3) The total path length, however, is twice the distance between the two players since the ball traveled this distance twice. Step 4) We then compare the magnitude of average velocity and the average speed. The average velocity is zero because the displacement is zero. Step 5) The average speed, calculated as the total path length divided by time, is greater than the average velocity. Step 6) Both scenarios can only be equal if the motion is unidirectional and in a straight line, akin to one-dimensional motion, as given in the problem."
