    "Question": "Q7: Given that l + m + n + o = 0, which of the given statements are true:\r\n(a) l, m, n and o each must be a null vector.\r\n(b) The magnitude of (l + n) equals the magnitude of (m+ o).\r\n(c) The magnitude of l can never be greater than the sum of the magnitudes of m, n and o.\r\n(d) m + n must lie in the plane of l and o if l and o are not collinear, and in the line of l and o, if they are collinear?",
    "Original Solution": "(a) False\r\nIn order to make l + m + n + o = 0, it is not necessary to have all the four given vectors to be null vectors. There are other combinations which can give the sum zero.\r\n(b) True\r\nl + m + n + o = 0\r\nl + n = \u2013 (m + o)\r\nTaking mode on both the sides,\r\nTherefore, the magnitude of (l + n) is the same as the magnitude of (m + o).\r\n(c) True\r\nl + m + n + o = 0\r\nl = (m + n + o)\r\nTaking mode on both the sides,\r\nEquation (i) shows the magnitude of l is equal to or less than the sum of the magnitudes of m, n and o.\r\n(d) True\r\nFor,\r\nl + m + n + o = 0\r\nThe resultant sum of the three vectors l, (m + n), and o can be zero only if (m + n) lie in a plane containing l and o, assuming that these three vectors are represented by the three sides of a triangle.\r\nIf l and o are collinear, then it implies that the vector (m + n) is in the line of l and o. This implication holds only then the vector sum of all the vectors will be zero. ",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the known equation, l + m + n + o = 0. This presents that the vectors l, m, n, and o sum up to a null vector.\n\nStep 2) Analyze part (a), which proposes that all vectors (l, m, n, and o) have to be null vectors. Recall that null vectors have a magnitude of zero, but the four vectors can possibly be non-zero but balance each other such that their total sum is zero. Conclusion is that the statement for (a) is False.\n\nStep 3) For part (b), examine that l + m + n + o = 0. If you rearrange this equation to l + n = -(m + o), this implies the magnitudes of l + n and m + o equal each other even though they point in opposite directions. Therefore, the statement for (b) is True.\n\nStep 4) Proceed to part (c), where we stipulate that the magnitude of l is less than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of m, n, and o. Deduced from l = -(m + n + o) and taking the magnitude on both sides, the magnitude of l must be either equal to or less than the combined magnitudes of m, n, and o. Therefore, the statement for (c) is True.\n\nStep 5) Finally for part (d), consider m + n must lie in the plane of l and o if l and o are not collinear and on the line of l and o if they are collinear. Remember that the sum of three vectors are representing the three sides of a triangle, thus the statement for (d) is True.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) State the given equation is l + m + n + o = 0, implying the total sum is a null vector.\n\nStep 2) Examine statement (a) to determine whether all vectors must be null vectors. Identify it as False as vectors can sum up to zero without them all being null.\n\nStep 3) Review statement (b) about the equivalence of magnitudes l + n and m + o. Confirm its truth by taking the magnitude of both sides.\n\nStep 4) Scrutinize statement (c) asserting the magnitude of l is equal to or less than the combined magnitudes of m, n, and o. Validate the statement by taking the magnitude of l = -(m + n + o).\n \nStep 5) Assess statement (d) about the position of m + n in relation to l and o, and acknowledge it as True, as the sum of m + n must lie in the plane of l and o for the total sum to be a null vector."
