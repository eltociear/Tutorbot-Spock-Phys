    "Question": "2. Molar volume is the volume occupied by 1 mol of any (ideal) gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP: 1 atmospheric pressure, 0 C). Show that it is 22.4 litres.",
    "Original Solution": "The ideal gas equation relating pressure (P), volume (V), and absolute temperature (T) is given as\r\nPV = nRT\r\nWhere R is the universal gas constant = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1\r\nn = Number of moles = 1\r\nT = Standard temperature = 273 K\r\nP = Standard pressure = 1 atm = 1.013 x 10^5 Nm^-2\r\nHence,\r\nV = nRT / P\r\n= 1 x 8.314 x 273 / 1.013 x 10^5\r\n= 0.0224 m^3\r\n= 22.4 litres\r\nTherefore, the molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 litres.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by understanding that molar volume represents the volume occupied by one mole of any ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is defined as the conditions of 1 atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 0 Celsius. \\n Step 2) The key to this problem is the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. This equation describes the relationship amongst pressure (P), volume (V), number of moles of gas (n), the universal gas constant (R), and absolute temperature (T). The 'n' is commonly involved in the discussion of molar concepts, and 'R' is a constant to make the units on both sides of the equation match. \\n Step 3) We already know the value for 'n'. In this case, 'n' = Number of moles = 1 since we are talking about molar volume. \\n Step 4) We also know 'T' = Standard temperature = 273 K. It's important to remember that the ideal gas equation requires temperature to be measured in Kelvin (K), not Celsius. So, we convert 0 C to 273 K. \\n Step 5) 'P' = Standard pressure = 1 atm = 1.013 x 10^5 Nm^-2. Pressure needs to be in agreement with the gas constant units, here it's in N/m^2. \\n Step 6) To find the volume 'V', we rearrange the equation to V = nRT / P. \\n Step 7) Now, substitute the known values into this equation: V = 1 x 8.314 x 273 / 1.013 x 10^5. From the provided solution, these are the values given for 'n', 'R', 'T', and 'P' respectively. Crack it and you will find the molar value in m^3. \\n Step 8) The result is V = 0.0224 m^3. But we need the volume in litres, one of the commonly used units in chemistry. So the final step is converting cubic meter to litres, where 1 m^3 is equal to 1000 litres. Therefore, 0.0224 m^3 is equal to 22.4 litres.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We start with the concept of molar volume at standard temperature and pressure (STP). \\n Step 2) We then make use of the ideal gas equation PV = nRT, which ties together the key variables we need: pressure, volume, and temperature. \\n Step 3) For molar volume, we set 'n' = 1. \\n Step 4) We set 'T' = 273 K (this is the Kelvin equivalent of 0 Celsius, which defines STP). \\n Step 5) We assign 'P' = 1.013 x 10^5 Nm^-2 (the standard pressure at STP in the units compatible with the gas constant). \\n Step 6) We rearrange the equation to isolate 'V'. \\n Step 7) Knowing the values of 'n', 'R', 'T', and 'P', we substitute them into our rearranged equation to calculate 'V'. \\n Step 8) The result is in cubic meters (m^3), so the final step is the conversion to litres, yielding V = 22.4 litres."
