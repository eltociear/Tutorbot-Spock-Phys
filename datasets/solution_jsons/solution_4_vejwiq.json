    "Question": "2.6 Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length?(a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale(b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale(c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "(a) Least count = 1- \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{9}{10}\\end{array} \\)= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{10}\\end{array} \\) = 0.01cm\r\n(b) Least count = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{pitch}{number of divisions}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{10000}\\end{array} \\) = 0.001 cm\r\n(c) least count = wavelength of light = 10^(-5) cm\r\n= 0.00001 cm\r\nWe can come to the conclusion that the optical instrument is the most precise device used to measure length.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start off by looking at the three different measuring devices presented and understand that the precision of a device is related to its least count, which is the smallest measurement that the device can distinguish. The lower the least count, the more precise the device is. Step 2) We first calculate the least count of the vernier calipers. The least count is found by subtracting 9/10 from 1 (the total distance covered by 20 divisions). This gives us a value of 0.01cm. Step 3) We then calculate the least count of the screw gauge. The least count of the screw gauge is computed as the pitch divided by the number of divisions, which in this case is 1 / 10000, resulting in a value of 0.001cm. Step 4) Finally, we determine the least count for the optical instrument. Given in the problem statement, the optical instrument can measure within a wavelength of light, which is equal to 10^(-5) cm or 0.00001 cm. Step 5) We now compare the least counts of the three devices. The optical instrument has the lowest least count (0.00001 cm), therefore, it is the most precise device for measuring length.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We understand that the precision of a device is indicated by its least count - the lower the least count, the higher the precision. Step 2) The least count of vernier calipers is calculated by subtracting proportion of total distance covered by the number of divisions from 1. For the example, it results in 0.01cm. Step 3) To get the least count of the screw gauge, we divide the pitch by the number of divisions. In this case we get a least count of 0.001cm. Step 4) The least count of the optical instrument is given directly as equal to a wavelength of light, which is 0.00001 cm. Step 5) The precision of the instruments are compared by looking at their least counts - here the optical instrument emerges as the most precise due to its smallest least count."
