    "Question": "7. A steam engine delivers 5.4\u00d710^8 J of work per minute and services 3.6 \u00d7 10^9 J of heat per minute from its boiler. What is the efficiency of the engine? How much heat is wasted per minute?",
    "Original Solution": "Given\r\nWork done by the steam engine per minute, W = 5.4 x 10^8 J\r\nHeat supplied from the boiler, H = 3.6 x 10^9 J\r\nEfficiency of the engine = Output Energy / Input Energy\r\nHence,\r\n\u03b7 = W / H\r\n= 5.4 x 10^8 / (3.6 x 10^9)\r\nOn simplification, we get,\r\n= 0.15\r\nTherefore, the percentage efficiency of the engine is 15%\r\nAmount of heat wasted = 3.6 x 10^9 \u2013 5.4 x 10^8\r\nWe get,\r\n= 30.6 x 10^8\r\n= 3.06 x 10^9 J\r\nHence, the amount of heat wasted per minute is 3.06 x 10^9 J",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the problem, we know the work done by the steam engine per minute is 5.4 x 10^8 J. This can be represented as W. This value represents the energy that is being output by the steam engine each minute. Step 2) We also know that the heat supplied from the boiler is 3.6 x 10^9 J which can be represented as H. This is the input energy that the steam engine is using to produce work. Step 3) To calculate efficiency, we use the equation 'Efficiency = Output Energy / Input Energy' i.e., \u03b7 = W / H. This equation indicates the proportion of the input energy that is successfully converted into output energy, Step 4) Plugging the known values into this equation, we get 5.4 x 10^8 / (3.6 x 10^9). This is a simple division operation. Step 5) After simplification, we find that the efficiency is 0.15. This results means that 15% of the input energy is successfully converted into the output work, Step 6) To find out how much heat is wasted, we subtract the work done from the heat supplied i.e., 3.6 x 10^9 \u2013 5.4 x 10^8. Step 7) Simplifying this subtraction, we find that the heat wasted is 3.06 x 10^9 J. This is the amount of heat that the engine has failed to convert into useful work.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values for work done (W) and heat supplied (H). Step 2) Understand these as the output and input energy of the steam engine. Step 3) Use the formula for efficiency, which is a ratio of output to input energy, \u03b7 = W / H. Step 4) Substitute the known values into the efficiency equation. Step 5) Simplify the equation to find that the efficiency is 15%, meaning 15% of the input energy is being converted into work. Step 6) Calculate the wasted heat by subtracting the work done from the heat supplied. Step 7) Simplify to find the value of wasted heat, which represents the amount of energy not being converted into useful work."
