    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by identifying the known values from the problem. These are: the length and cross-sectional area of the steel wire (l1 = 4.7 m and a1 = 3.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2) and those of the copper wire (l2 = 3.5 m and a2 = 4.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2). Note that both wires stretch by the same amount under a given load, so the change in length for both, \u0394l, is equal. The applied force, F, is also the same for both. \nStep 2) To find Young's modulus for each material, use the formula for Young's modulus: Y = F/(a*l/ \u0394l). This formula describes the ratio of the stress applied to a material to the strain the material undergoes in response. \nStep 3) Apply this formula to the steel wire to calculate its Young's modulus, Y1. Insert the known values into the formula: Y1 = F/(a1*l1/ \u0394l), which using numerical substitution, becomes Y1 = F/(3.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2 * 4.7 m/\u0394l). This is equation 1. \nStep 4) Apply the same formula to the copper wire to calculate its Young's modulus, Y2. With the known values inserted, it becomes: Y2 = F/(4.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2 * 3.5 m/ \u0394l). This is equation 2. \nStep 5) Dividing equation 1 by equation 2, the formula for the ratio of Young's modulus of steel to that of copper can be expressed as Y1/Y2 = (4.7 m / (3.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2)) * ((4.0 \u00d7 10^-5 m^2) / 3.5 m). \nStep 6) When we compute this, we get the numerical value of the ratio, which in this case is 1.79.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Determine the known values, including the lengths and cross-sections of the wires, the equal change in their lengths, and the equal force applied. \nStep 2) Recall the formula for Young's modulus, which expresses the strain (the ratio of change in length to original length) experienced under a certain stress (the force applied per unit area). \nStep 3) With the formula Y = F/(a*l/ \u0394l), where Y is Young's modulus, F is the force, a is the area of the cross-section, l is the original length and \u0394l is the change in length, apply it individually to the steel and copper wires, generating two equations, one for each material.\nStep 4) To find the ratio of Young's modulus of steel to that of copper, divide the equation for steel by the one for copper.\nStep 5) Simplify this new expression to compute the numerical value of the ratio."
