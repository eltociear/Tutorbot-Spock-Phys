    "Question": "6. A constant force acting on a body of mass 3.0 kg changes its speed from 2.0 ms^(-1) to 3.5 ms^(-1) in 25 s. The direction of the motion of the body remains unchanged. What is the magnitude and direction of the force?",
    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass, m = 3.0 Kg\r\nu = 2.0 m/s\r\nv = 3.5 m/s\r\nt = 25 s\r\nF = ma\r\nF = m [(v-u)/t] (since a = (v -u)/t )\r\nF = 3 [ (3.5 \u2013 2)/25] = 0.18 N\r\nThe force acts in the direction of motion of the body",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides certain values, including the mass of the body m=3.0 kg, the initial speed u=2.0 m/s, the final speed v=3.5 m/s, and the time taken for this change in speed t=25 s. These values are our known variables that need to be plugged into appropriate equations to find the solution. Step 2) We need to find the magnitude and direction of the force. To do this, we use the fundamental concept of mechanics that Force F equals mass m times acceleration a (F=ma). Our task is to find the value of the force F. Step 3) We don't have the acceleration 'a' directly given in the problem. However, we know that acceleration is the change in velocity over time (a = (v -u)/t ). We substitute this definition of acceleration into our force formula. Doing so, we get F = m [(v-u)/t]. Step 4) Next, we plug in our known values into this formula. This equates to F = 3 [ (3.5 \u2013 2)/25], which gives the magnitude of the force as 0.18 Newton (N). Step 5) The direction of the force will be in the same direction as the change in velocity because force causes an object to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Given that the direction of the motion of the body remains unchanged, it is justified to conclude that the force acts in the direction of the motion of the body.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We identify the known variables: mass m=3 kg, initial speed u=2 m/s, final speed v=3.5 m/s, and time t=25 s. Step 2) We identify the need to use the formula of force F=ma to find the magnitude and direction of the force. Step 3) Since we don't have the value of 'a', we replace it with (v -u)/t in the force equation as acceleration is defined as the change in velocity over time. Our formula now becomes F = m [(v-u)/t].  Step 4) We substitute our known values into this equation to get F = 3 [ (3.5 \u2013 2)/25], resulting in the magnitude of the force as 0.18 N. Step 5) Because force is linked to the change in velocity and the direction of motion of the body is constant as per the problem statement, we infer that the force acts in the direction of the body's motion."
