    "Question": "2.17 One mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L (molar volume). What is the ratio of molar volume to the atomic volume of a mole of hydrogen (Take the size of the hydrogen molecule to be about 1 ?)? Why is this ratio so large?\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Radius = 0.5 A = 0.5 x 10-10 m\r\nVolume = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{4}{3}\\end{array} \\) x \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{22}{7}\\end{array} \\) x ( 0.5 x 10^(-10))3\r\n= 0.524 x 10^(-30) m^3\r\n1 hydrogen mole contains 6.023 x 10^23 hydrogen atoms.\r\nVolume of 1 mole of hydrogen atom = 6.023 x 10^23 x 0.524 x 10^(-30)\r\n= 3.16 x 10^(-7) m^3\r\nVm = 22.4 L = 22.4 x 10^(-3) m^3\r\nThe molar volume is 7.1 x 10^4 times more than the atomic volume. Hence, the inter-atomic separation in hydrogen gas is larger than the size of the hydrogen atom.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem first gives us the size of a hydrogen molecule, which is about 1 Angstrom (A). But for our calculations, we need the radius. So, we take half of the diameter to get the radius of the hydrogen atom, which is 0.5 A. We also convert this to meters because we are working with SI units, resulting in a radius of 0.5 x 10^-10 m. Step 2) Once we have the radius, the next thing we need to find out is the volume of the hydrogen atom. This is done using the formula for the volume of a sphere, as we are assuming the hydrogen atom to be spherical. The volume is therefore given by (4/3)\u03c0r^3 where r is the radius. Plugging in our value of the radius, we find the volume to be around 0.524 x 10^-30 m^3. Step 3) Getting the volume of one single hydrogen atom is not enough, we need the volume of one mole of hydrogen atoms. As 1 mole contains Avogadro's number of atoms (6.023 x 10^23), we simply multiply the volume of one atom by Avogadro's number to get the atomic volume of one mole of hydrogen. This results in an atomic volume of approximately 3.16 x 10^-7 m^3. Step 4) The problem tells us that one mole of any ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L, so we convert this molar volume to cubic meters to match our units, getting 22.4 x 10^-3 m^3. Step 5) Finally, we find the ratio of the molar volume to the atomic volume by simply dividing the molar volume by the atomic volume. This ratio comes out to be approximately 7.1 x 10^4, meaning the molar volume is 7.1 x 10^4 times greater than the atomic volume. The ratio is so large because there is a lot of empty space between the atoms in a gas.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We're given the size of a hydrogen molecule and convert this to the radius in meters, to fit in with SI units. Step 2) We then use the formula for the volume of a sphere to calculate the volume of one hydrogen atom. Step 3) As there are Avogadro's number of atoms in one mole, we then multiply the volume of one hydrogen atom by this number to calculate the atomic volume of a mole of hydrogen. Step 4) We're told the molar volume of any ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure is 22.4 L, so we convert this to cubic meters. Step 5) We then calculate the ratio of the molar volume to the atomic volume. This ratio is huge because there is a lot of empty space between the atoms in a gas."
