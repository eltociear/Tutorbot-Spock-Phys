    "Question": "2.25. A man walking briskly in the rain with speed v must slant his umbrella forward, making an angle \u03b8 with the vertical. A student derives the following relation between \u03b8 and v: tan \u03b8 = v and checks that the relation has a correct limit: as v \u21920, \u03b8 \u21920, as expected (We are assuming there is no strong wind and that the rain falls vertically for a stationary man). Do you think this relation can be correct? If not, guess the correct relation.",
    "Original Solution": "According to the principle of homogeneity of dimensional equations,\r\nDimensions of L.H.S. = Dimensions of R.H.S.\r\nIn relation v = tan \u03b8, tan \u03b8 is a trigonometric function, and it is dimensionless. The dimension of v is  [L1 T-1]. Therefore, this relation is incorrect.\r\nTo make the relation correct, the L.H.S. must be divided by the velocity of rain, u.\r\nTherefore, the relation becomes\r\nv/u= tan \u03b8\r\nThis relation is correct dimensionally",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We'll begin by observing the provided relation, tan \u03b8 = v, where \u03b8 is the angle the umbrella makes with the vertical and v is the speed of the man. Remember that, in physics, one of the basic checks we can make on equations is a dimensional analysis. If the units on each side of an equation match, there's a chance that the equation could be meaningful.\nStep 2) It's important to note that \u03b8 is an angle, and when we take the tangent of an angle, the result is a ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle, which is dimensionless. Hence, the trigonometric function tan \u03b8 is dimensionless. This means it doesn't have any units associated with it.\nStep 3) On the other hand, v is the speed of the man, which is expressed in units of distance over time, or [L1 T-1]. Looking at the units now, we see that the left-hand side of our equation is dimensionless, while the right-hand side has dimensions. Thus, dimensions of LHS do not equal to R.H.S and it contradicts the principle of homogeneity of dimensional equations.\nStep 4) Now, in order to make this equation meaningful, we have to adjust it so that both sides have the same dimensions. To do this, we'll introduce a new term, the velocity of the rain, u, which also has dimensions of speed, [L1 T-1].\nStep 5) Notice that when we divide v by u, we result in a dimensionless ratio. We let this ratio be equal to tan \u03b8, which gives us the corrected equation: v/u = tan \u03b8. This new equation is dimensionally correct because both sides are now dimensionless, and it aligns with the principle of homogeneity of dimensional equations.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Look at the provided equation (tan \u03b8 = v) and note the dimension of each side (tan \u03b8 is dimensionless, v has dimensions of [L1 T-1]).\nStep 2) Understand that the dimensions on each side of the equation must match for an equation to potentially be meaningful, which isn't happening here.\nStep 3) Find a way to adjust the equation so that both sides match. Introduce a new term, u, which stands for the speed of the rain.\nStep 4) Divide v by u to get a dimensionless quantity. This will equate this to tan \u03b8, creating a new equation (v/u = tan \u03b8) that is dimensionally consistent."
