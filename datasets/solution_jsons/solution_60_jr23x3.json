    "Question": "Q28: Can we associate a vector with \r\n(i) a sphere\r\n(ii) the length of a wire bent into a loop \r\n(iii) a plane area\r\nClarify for the same.",
    "Original Solution": "No, No, Yes\r\n(i) We can\u2019t associate the volume of a sphere with a vector, but the area of a sphere can be associated with an area vector.\r\n(ii) We can\u2019t associate the length of a wire bent into a loop with a vector.\r\n(iii) We can associate a plane area with a vector.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by looking into each part of the question. \nStep 2) For part (i), the question wants to associate a sphere with a vector. It's important to note that vectors are quantities which have both direction and magnitude. A sphere, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional object with volume, but doesn't have a specific direction associated with it. Therefore, we can't associate a sphere's volume with a vector. However, the area of a sphere could be tied to an area vector.\nStep 3) For part (ii), we are talking about the length of a wire bent into a loop. Again, length is a scalar quantity, possessing only magnitude and no direction. Hence, we can't associate the length of a wire with a vector.\nStep 4) In part (iii), when it comes to a plane area, it can be associated with a vector. The reason is that a plane area can be represented by a surface vector that is perpendicular to it and whose magnitude equals the value of the area.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that the problem is asking whether you can associate different geometrical forms with vectors.\nStep 2) Understand that vectors represent magnitude and direction, whereas a sphere's volume or wire's length are scalar quantities that carry no directional information. Thus, a sphere and a wire's length cannot be correlated with a vector.\nStep 3) Recognize that a plane area is different in that it can be represented by a surface vector perpendicular to the plane. The magnitude of this vector would be the value of the area, hence, a plane area can be associated with a vector."
