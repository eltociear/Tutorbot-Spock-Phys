    "Question": "Q20.

    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nMass of one oxygen molecule, m = 5.30 \u00d7 10^(\u201326) kg\r\nThus, the mass of each oxygen atom = m/2\r\nMoment of inertia of it, I = 1.94 \u00d7 10^(\u201346) kg m^2\r\nVelocity of the molecule, v = 500 m/s\r\nThe distance between the two atoms in the molecule = 2r\r\nThus, the moment of inertia I is calculated as\r\nl =(m/2)r^2 + (m/2)r^2 = mr^2, r = ( I / m)1/2\r\n=> (1.94 \u00d7 10^(-46) / 5.36 \u00d7 10^(-26) )^(1/2)  =  0.60 \u00d7 10^(-10) m\r\nGiven,\r\nK.Erot = (2/3)K.Etrans\r\n(1/2) I \u03c9^2 = (2/3) \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 mv^2mr^2\u03c9^2 = (2/3)mv^2\r\nTherefore,\u03c9 = (2/3)1/2 (v/r)\r\n= (2/3)^(1/2) \u00d7 (500 / 0.6 \u00d7 10^(-10)) = 6.88 \u00d7 10^12 rad/s.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given the mass of one oxygen molecule as m = 5.30 \u00d7 10^(\u201326) kg. Since an oxygen molecule consists of two oxygen atoms, the mass of each oxygen atom would be half the total mass, or m/2. Step 2) The moment of inertia of the molecule, symbolized as I, is also given as 1.94 \u00d7 10^(\u201346) kg m^2. This moment of inertia is about an axis through its centre perpendicular to the lines joining the two atoms. Step 3) The average speed of the molecule, v, is given as 500 m/s. Step 4) Assuming the distance between the two atoms can be represented as 2r. We can use the formula for moment of inertia here to get l = (m/2)r^2 + (m/2)r^2 = mr^2. From this, we can solve for r to find the distance between the atoms as r = (I / m)^(1/2). Hence, r = (1.94 \u00d7 10^(-46) / 5.36 \u00d7 10^(-26))^(1/2) = 0.60 \u00d7 10^(-10) m. Step 5) We also know about kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of rotation (K.Erot) is said to be two-thirds of the kinetic energy of translation (K.Etrans). Mathematically, this can be written as (1/2) I \u03c9^2 = (2/3) \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 mv^2. We can simplify both sides, leading to mr^2\u03c9^2 = (2/3)mv^2. Step 6) Finally, when we solve this last equation for \u03c9, the average angular velocity, we find \u03c9 = (2/3)^(1/2) \u00d7 (500 / 0.6 \u00d7 10^(-10)) = 6.88 \u00d7 10^12 rad/s.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) First, identify the given values including the mass of an oxygen molecule and its moment of inertia. Step 2) Determine the mass of an individual oxygen atom (which is half of the molecule's mass). Step 3) Understand and acknowledge the average speed of the molecule that is provided. Step 4) To find the distance between the atoms, use the formula of moment of inertia. Then solve for r in terms of the given values. Step 5) The relationship between the rotational and translational kinetic energy is given. Use this to develop an equation involving the moment of inertia, mass, velocity, and angular velocity. Step 6) Solve the equation for the average angular velocity."
