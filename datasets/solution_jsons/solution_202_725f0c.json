    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem details present two important pieces of information to us, firstly, the 'coefficient of volume expansion of glycerine', which is \u03b1V = 49 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1), and, secondly, the 'rise in temperature', that is \u0394T = 30\u00b0 C. These are known values from the problem statement.\\n\nStep 2) Now let's understand the term 'fractional change in volume'. If the volume of the glycerine changes, possibly due to a change in temperature, the fractional change in volume is the change in volume divided by the original volume, represented by \u0394V/V. \u03b1V \u0394T represents the fractional volume change due to a change in temperature.\\n\nStep 3) Now that we know this, we can substitute our given values and we get an equation as follows: V_T2 - V_T1 = V_T1 \u03b1V \u0394T, where V_T2 is the final volume, V_T1 is the initial volume, \u03b1V is the coefficient of volume expansion, and \u0394T is the change in temperature. This equation simply states the initial volume adjusted by the volume change due to temperature rise equals the final volume.\\n\nStep 4) However, volume can also be presented as mass over density; let's substitute this into our equation: m/\u03c1_T2 - m/\u03c1_T1 = m/\u03c1_T1 \u03b1V \u0394T, where \u03c1_T2 is the final density, \u03c1_T1 is the initial density, and m is mass. This equation now links the change in volume to the change in density, since density= mass/volume.\\n\nStep 5) After rearranging the formula a bit, we can determine the fractional change in density as given by the equation (\u03c1_T1 - \u03c1_T2) / \u03c1_T2, where \u03c1_T1 is the initial density, and \u03c1_T2 is the final density after the rise in temperature. The result is a measure of how much the density decreases for every unit of volume increase due to temperature rise.\\n\nStep 6) After performing the calculations using the provided values, we find that the fractional change in density is 1.47 \u00d7 10^-2, which is our final answer.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the problem details which are the 'coefficient of volume expansion of glycerine', \u03b1V = 49 \u00d7 10^(-5) K^(-1), and the 'rise in temperature', \u0394T = 30\u00b0 C.\\n\nStep 2) Understand the term 'fractional change in volume' as the ratio of change in volume followed by the temperature change divided by the initial volume, or \u03b1V \u0394T.\\n\nStep 3) Apply these knowns to the equation of V_T2 - V_T1 = V_T1 \u03b1V \u0394T, to express the relationship between initial volume, final volume and temperature rise.\\n\nStep 4) Substitute volume as mass over density into the equation, yielding m/\u03c1_T2 - m/\u03c1_T1 = m/\u03c1_T1 \u03b1V \u0394T, to link volume change with density change, since density= mass/volume.\\n\nStep 5) Reformat the equation to highlight the fractional change in density as (\u03c1_T1 - \u03c1_T2) / \u03c1_T2. \\\nStep 6) Upon final calculation, obtain the fractional change in density which is 1.47 \u00d7 10^-2."
