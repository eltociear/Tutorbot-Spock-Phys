    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by identifying the information given in the question. This includes the temperature of the helium atom (THe), which is -20 degrees Celsius or 253 Kelvin (K), the atomic mass of argon (MAr), which is 39.9 atomic units (u), and the atomic mass of helium (MHe), which is 4.0 u. Additionally, we set a variable (Vrms)Ar to denote the root mean square (rms) speed of argon and (Vrms)He to denote the rms speed of helium. All together, we have: THe = -20 degrees C = 253 K, MAr = 39.9 u, MHe = 4.0 u, (Vrms)Ar, and (Vrms)He. Step 2) Next, we use the formula for the rms speed of argon: (Vrms)Ar = \u221a3RTAr / MAr, where R is the universal gas constant and TAr is the temperature of argon. Similarly, the rms speed of helium is given by: (Vrms)He = \u221a3RTHe / MHe. Step 3) The problem states that the root mean square speed of argon is equal to that of helium at -20 degrees Celsius: (Vrms)Ar = (Vrms)He. Thus, we can set the two equations equal to each other: \u221a3RTAr / MAr = \u221a3RTHe / MHe. After simplifying, we find that the ratio of the temperature of argon to the atomic mass of argon is equal to the ratio of the temperature of helium to the atomic mass of helium (or, TAr / MAr = THe / MHe). Step 4) Solving for the temperature of argon, we arrive at: TAr = THe / MHe x MAr. Plugging in the given information, we get TAr = (253 / 4) x 39.9, which simplifies to TAr = 2523.675. Rounding to significant digits and expressing in scientific notation, we see that the desired temperature of argon is approximately TAr = 2.52 x 10^3 K.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given parameters from the question: the temperature of helium (THe = -20 C = 253 K), the atomic mass of argon (MAr = 39.9 u), the atomic mass of helium (MHe = 4.0 u), and set variables for the rms speed of argon ((Vrms)Ar) and helium ((Vrms)He). Step 2) Use the formula for rms speed to establish equations for the rms speed of argon and helium: (Vrms)Ar = \u221a3RTAr / MAr and (Vrms)He = \u221a3RTHe / MHe. Step 3) Set the two equations from Step 2) equal to each other - this translates the problem statement that the rms speed of argon is equal to that of helium: \u221a3RTAr / MAr = \u221a3RTHe / MHe. After simplifying, we find TAr / MAr = THe / MHe. Step 4) Solve for TAr to find the temperature of argon: TAr = THe / MHe x MAr = (253 / 4) x 39.9. Then express the result in appropriate notation: TAr = 2.52 x 10^3 K."
