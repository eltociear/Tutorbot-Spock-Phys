    "Question": "2. 11. The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m, and 2.01 cm, respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant figures.",
    "Original Solution": "Area of the rectangular sheet = length x breadth\r\n= 4.234 x 1.005 = 4.255 m^2= 4.3 m^2\r\nThe volume of the rectangular sheet = length x breadth x thickness = 4.234 x 1.005  x  2.01 x 10^-2 = 8.55 x 10^(-2) m^3.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the given values. The length of the sheet is 4.234 m, the breadth is 1.005 m, and the thickness is 2.01 cm. These are the dimensions of the sheet. It's important to observe that thickness is given in cm, while other dimensions are in meters. To compute the area and volume of the sheet accurately, all the dimensions need to be in the same unit.\nStep 2) Use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = length x breadth. The area of the sheet in this case can be calculated as 4.234 m x 1.005 m = 4.255 m^2. According to significant figures rule, the final answer must be rounded off to the least number of decimal places in the given measurements. Hence, we round it off to one decimal point to give 4.3 m^2.\nStep 3) Convert the thickness to meters to maintain unit consistency. To convert cm to meters, multiply the measurement by 10^-2. So, the thickness becomes 2.01 x 10^-2 = 0.0201 m.\nStep 4) Use the formula for volume of a rectangle, Volume = length x breadth x thickness. Substituting the given values into the equation gives 4.234 m x 1.005 m x 0.0201 m = 8.55 x 10^(-2) m^3. We apply the same rule of significant figures here, but the answer already has sufficient number of decimal places.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given measurements for the length, breadth, and thickness of the sheet. Be aware of the unit in which each measurement is given.\nStep 2) Use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length x breadth) and substitute the given values. Keep in mind the significant figures rule while rounding off the final answer.\nStep 3) To ensure unit consistency, convert the thickness from cm to m using the conversion factor (1 m = 100 cm).\nStep 4) Use the formula for volume of a rectangular prism (Volume = length x breadth x thickness) and substitute the given values, which now are all in meters. Apply the significant figures rule to the answer as well."
