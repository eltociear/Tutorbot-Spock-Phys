    "Question": "In an inelastic collision of two bodies, the quantities which do not change after the collision are the total kinetic energy/total linear momentum/total energy of the system of two bodies",
    "Original Solution": "Total linear momentum\r\nIrrespective of the elastic collision or an inelastic collision, the total linear momentum remains the same.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand the problem at hand: The problem asks which quantities remain constant after an inelastic collision takes place within a system of two bodies. The options provided are total kinetic energy, total linear momentum, or total energy of the system. \n\nStep 2) Define the types of collision: An 'inelastic' collision is one in which kinetic energy is not conserved, meaning it changes afterwards. This means that total kinetic energy cannot remain constant after the collision.\n\nStep 3) Recall the law of conservation of linear momentum: This law states that if no external force acts upon a system, then the total linear momentum of the system remains constant, irrespective of the nature of the collision (be it elastic or inelastic).\n\nStep 4) Analyze the concept of total energy: Total energy does include kinetic energy, which doesn't remain constant in an inelastic collision as we discussed in step 2. Therefore, total energy also cannot remain constant after the collision.\n\nStep 5) Conclude the findings: Based on the above analysis, only total linear momentum remains the same in an inelastic collision of two bodies.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand what the question asks, which is to identify the quantities that remain constant after an inelastic collision. \n\nStep 2) Identify that an inelastic collision implies a change in kinetic energy, disqualifying it as a constant quantity. \n\nStep 3) Note that the law of conservation of linear momentum states that total linear momentum remains constant in a system where no external force is acting regardless of the nature of the collision, making this a potential answer. \n\nStep 4) Recognize that total energy includes components that do not remain constant, disqualifying it as a constant quantity. \n\nStep 5) Based on the above steps, conclude that only total linear momentum remains constant after an inelastic collision."
