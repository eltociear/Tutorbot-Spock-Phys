    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We're given the equation for a travelling harmonic wave as y (x, t) = 2.0 cos 2\u03c0 (10t \u2013 0.0080x + 0.35), which simplifies to = 2.0 cos (20\u03c0t \u2013 0.016\u03c0x + 0.70 \u03c0). In this equation, x and y are in cm, and t is in secs. The propagation constant k is given as 0.0160 \u03c0 and the angular frequency \u03c9 equals to 20 \u03c0 rad/s, while the amplitude a is 2 cm. This is our starting point. Step 2) We know that the phase difference \u03a6 is expressed as kx = 2\u03c0/ \u03bb. This is the equation we'll use to find the phase difference between the oscillatory motion of different points. Step 3) For a distance of 8 m, which is 800 cm, we plug x = 800 cm into \u03a6 = kx. Thus, \u03a6 = 0.016 \u03c0 \u00d7 800 = 12.8 \u03c0 rad. This is the first answer. Step 4) For a distance of 1 m, or 100 cm, we use the same equation but with x = 100 cm. Therefore, \u03a6 = 0.016 \u03c0 \u00d7 100 = 1.6 \u03c0 rad. This gives us the second answer. Step 5) For a distance of \u03bb /2, we plug this value into \u03a6 = (2\u03c0/ \u03bb) \u00d7 \u03bb/2, so \u03a6 = \u03c0 rad. This is the answer for the third part. Step 6) For a distance of 6\u03bb /4, we again use the formula and substitute the given value into \u03a6 = (2\u03c0/ \u03bb) \u00d7 ( 6\u03bb/4), arriving at \u03a6 = 3 \u03c0 rad. This gives us our fourth and final answer.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We start with the given equation for a travelling harmonic wave y (x, t) = 2.0 cos (20\u03c0t \u2013 0.016\u03c0x + 0.70 \u03c0) and the given conditions. Step 2) From this, we use the equation for phase difference \u03a6 = kx = 2\u03c0/ \u03bb. Step 3) To find the phase difference for 8 m or 800 cm, we plug in 800 into the equation \u03a6 = kx to get \u03a6 = 12.8 \u03c0 rad. Step 4) For 1 m or 100 cm, we use the same equation and plug in 100 to get \u03a6 = 1.6 \u03c0 rad. Step 5) Similarly, for a distance of \u03bb /2, we use the given values to get \u03a6 = \u03c0 rad. Step 6) Finally, for 6\u03bb /4, we input the given values into the equation to find that \u03a6 = 3 \u03c0 rad."
