    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand the question: We need to find out how much energy must be expended to launch a spaceship out of the solar system. The spaceship is originally on Mars, and we are provided with the masses of the spaceship, the Sun, and Mars, the radius of Mars and its orbit, and the Universal Gravitational Constant G. Step 2) Understand the known quantities: We are given the mass of the spaceship (ms = 1000kg), the mass of the Sun (M = 2\u00d710^30 kg), the mass of Mars (mm = 6.4\u00d710^23 kg), the radius of the Mars orbit (R = 2.28\u00d710^11 m = 2.28\u00d710^8 km converted to meters), the radius of Mars (r = 3395\u00d710^3 m = 3395 km converted to meters), and the Universal Gravitational Constant (G = 6.67\u00d710^-11 N m^2 kg^\u22122). Step 3) Calculate the potential energy of the spaceship due to the gravitational attraction of the Sun: Potential energy (Us) can be found using the equation \u2212GMms/R, where G is the Universal Gravitational Constant, M is the mass of the Sun, ms is the mass of the spaceship, and R is the radius of the Mars orbit. Step 4) Calculate the potential energy of the spaceship due to the gravitational attraction of Mars: Similarly, this potential energy (Um) can be found using the equation \u2212G(mm)(ms)/r, where mm is the mass of Mars, ms is the mass of the spaceship, and r is the radius of Mars. Step 5) Calculate the total energy of the spaceship: The total energy of the spaceship (E) is found by the sum of Us and Um. Notice that both of these values are negative, indicating that the spaceship is bound to the system. Step 6) Calculate the energy required to launch the spaceship out of the solar system: This energy is found by taking the negative of the total energy of the spaceship (\u2212E), indicating that the energy must be expended in the opposite direction of the system's gravitational pull. This results in [GMms/R] + [G(mm)(ms)/r] = G(ms)[(M/R) + (mm/r)]. Step 7) Substitute the known values into the above equation and perform the calculations. The energy required to launch the spaceship out of the solar system is 5.91x10^11 J.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) List all known quantities given in the problem. Step 2) Use the formula for potential energy to find the energy of the spaceship due to the gravitational forces of the Sun and Mars separately. These formulas are \u2212GMms/R and \u2212G(mm)(ms)/r respectively. Notice that these are negative, meaning that the spaceship is bound to the system gravity. Step 3) Add these two values together to find the total potential energy of the spaceship. Step 4) To escape the solar system, we need to expend energy equal to the absolute value of the total potential energy. This gives the formula: G(ms)[(M/R) + (mm/r)]. Step 5) Substitute in the appropriate values and perform the calculation to find the energy required to launch the spaceship out of the solar system."
