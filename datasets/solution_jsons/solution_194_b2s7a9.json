    "Question": "Q.2: Two absolute scales, A and B, have triple points of water defined to be 200 A and 350 B. What is the relation between TA and TB?",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nThe triple point of water on absolute scale B, T2 = 400 B\r\nThe triple point of water on absolute scale A, T1 = 200 A\r\nThe triple point of water on the Kelvin scale, TK = 273.15 K\r\n273.15 K on the Kelvin scale is equivalent to 200 A on the absolute scale A.\r\n200 A = 273.15 K\r\nThus, A = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 273.15 }{ 200 }\\end{array} \\)\r\n273.15 K on the Kelvin scale is equivalent to 350 B on the absolute scale B.\r\n350 B = 273.15 KThus, B = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 273.15 }{ 350 }\\end{array} \\)\r\nLet TA and TB be the triple point of water on scales A and B, respectively.\r\nThus, we have\r\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}273.15 \\times \\frac{ T_{ A } }{ 200 } = 273.15 \\times \\frac{ T_{ B } }{ 200 }\\end{array} \\)\r\nTherefore, TA : TB = 4 : 7",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We're given two absolute scales, A and B, with defined triple points of water at 200 A and 350 B, respectively. In the context of temperature, the triple point of water is the unique temperature at which ice, water, and steam can coexist. This point is an exact measure on any temperature scale, and it serves as a useful conversion point between scales.\n\nStep 2) The problem gives us the temperatures for the triple points on each absolute scale: T1 = 200 A for scale A, and T2 = 350 B for scale B. However, we also learn that the triple point on the Kelvin scale, TK, is set at 273.15 K. \n\nStep 3) The next step is to find a conversion factor for each scale so that we can relate them to each other. We start by noting that 200 A is equivalent to 273.15 K, thus giving us the equation 200 A = 273.15 K. Rearranging this to solve for A, we have A = 273.15 K / 200 = 1.36575 K/A.\n\nStep 4) Likewise, we note that 350 B equals to 273.15 K, thus B, calculated in the same way, equals to 273.15 K / 350 = 0.78042 K/B.\n\nStep 5) Now that we know how to convert temperature from absolute scales A and B to Kelvin, we can relate the temperature TA on scale A to the temperature TB on scale B. We do this through the following equation: 273.15 * TA / 200 = 273.15 * TB / 350. The respective coefficients of TA and TB result from replacing the value of A and B derived from steps 3 and 4.\n\nStep 6) Simplifying this equation, it yields TA : TB = 4 : 7. This is the relationship between temperature given on scales A and B, and it's the answer to the problem.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that the triple point of water is a unique, exact temperature and is the same on any scale. We're given the triple point temperatures on two absolute scales A and B.\n\nStep 2) Notice that the problem gives us the triple-point temperatures both in terms of Kelvin and of scales A and B. \n\nStep 3) Find the conversion factors for scales A and B by setting the given temperatures equal to the known Kelvin triple point temperature and solving for A and B. \n\nStep 4) With the conversion factors, we can relate temperature measurement on the A scale to that on the B scale by setting their equivalent temperatures in Kelvin equal to each other.\n\nStep 5) Simplify the resulting equation to find the relationship between temperatures TA and TB on scales A and B, respectively."
