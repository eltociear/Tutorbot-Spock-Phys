    "Question": "Q.9. A brass wire 1.8 m long at 27 C is held taut with little tension between two rigid supports.

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the values given in the problem. You are given: the initial length of the brass wire (l) as 1.8 meters; the initial temperature (T1) as 27 degrees Celsius; the final temperature (T2) as -39 degrees Celsius; the diameter of the wire (d) as 2.0 mm, which converts to 2\u00d710^(\u22123) meters; the coefficient of linear expansion of brass (\u03b1) as 2.0\u00d710^(\u22125) K^(\u22121); and Young\u2019s modulus of brass (Y), which is a measure of its rigidity, as 0.91\u00d710^11 Pascal(Pa). You are asked to find the tension developed in the wire, indicated by (F). Step 2) Understand the relationship between Young\u2019s modulus, stress and strain. The formula to calculate Young's modulus is Y = stress / strain. Since stress is also equal to force / area (F/A) and strain is change in length over original length (\u0394L/L), substitute the equations into the Young's modulus formula to get Y = (F x L) /(A x \u0394L). Rearranging the equation, you get \u0394L=F\u00d7L/(A\u00d7Y). In this equation, A is the cross-sectional area of the wire and can be calculated as A = (\u03c0d^2)/4 = (\u03c0(2\u00d710^\u22123)^2) / 4. Step 3) Understand that the change in length of the wire (\u0394L) can also be calculated using thermal expansion principles, given by the formula: \u0394L= \u03b1L(T2 -T1).Step 4) Set these two equations for \u0394L equal to each other to relate the the tension force in the wire (F), the change in temperature, and the physical properties of the wire. This gives you \u03b1L(T2\u2212T1)=(F\u00d7L)/(A\u00d7Y). Solve the equation for F: F = [\u03b1L(T2\u2212T1) x A x Y]/L, simplifying to F = \u03b1(T2\u2212T1)Y\u03c0(d/2)^2. Step 5) Substitute the known values into the equation to find F. F = 2\u00d710^(\u22125) \u00d7 (\u221239\u221227) x 0.91\u00d710^11 \u00d73.14 x ((2\u00d710^(\u22123)) / 2)^2, which equals = \u2013 377.18, or \u2013 3.77 x 10^2 N. The negative sign indicates tension is being applied in the inward direction. Thus, the tension developed in the wire is 3.77\u00d710^2 N.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the provided values and set up necessary equations. The main two equations being Young's modulus, Y = (F x L) /(A x \u0394L), and the thermal expansion formula \u0394L= \u03b1L(T2 -T1). Step 2) Equate the two formulas for \u0394L to form a single equation that includes all variables of interest, leading to F = \u03b1(T2\u2212T1)Y\u03c0(d/2)\u00b2, where F is the tension in the wire. Step 3) Substitute known values into the equation to solve for F, the tension in the wire. With negative sign indicating the inward direction, the tension developed is 3.77\u00d710^2 N."
