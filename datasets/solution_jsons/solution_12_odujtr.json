    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we have to understand what we are trying to achieve. We are given four different formulas for the displacement of a particle. Each of these formulas involves a variable y for displacement, a variable a, and the sinusoidal function applied to a certain argument. Our aim is to check whether each formula is dimensionally correct. In physics, an equation is dimensionally correct if all terms on both sides of the equation have the same dimensions.\n Step 2) Let's start with Formula (a). We have y = a sin (2\u03c0t/T). It's noted in the textbook solution that the dimensions of displacement y are M0 L1 T0, which represents no mass, one length, and no time. Also, they state that the dimension of variable a has the same dimensions as y (M0 L1 T0), and the sin function argument doesn't carry any dimensions (M0 L0 T0). So, fundamentally, the dimensions on both sides of the equation match, making this formula dimensionally correct.\n Step 3) Moving on to Formula (b), the textbook solution states that the equation is dimensionally incorrect. It's because the dimensions on both sides of the equation do not match up and this violates the principal of dimensional analysis.\n Step 4) Similarly, for Formula (c), the textbook solution informs us that it is also dimensionally incorrect because the dimensions on either side of the equation do not match.\n Step 5) Finally, for Formula (d), we revisit the same process as in step 2, but the given formula is slightly more complex. Despite its complexity, the solution follows the same method of checking the dimensions on both sides of equation, ending up with the result that this formula is also dimensionally correct.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) The problem involves checking for dimensional correctness of four given formulas of particle displacement. This involves checking if the dimensions on both sides of an equation match.\n Step 2) For Formula (a), the dimensions for y, a and the argument of the sin function are checked. We find that all dimensions match up, hence the formula is dimensionally correct.\n Step 3) For Formulas (b) and (c), the dimensions on both sides do not match, violating the principle of dimensional analysis. Hence, these formulas are dimensionally incorrect.\n Step 4) For Formula (d), despite its complexity, by comparing the dimensions for y, a and the argument of the functions (sin and cos), we find that they match on both sides of the equation. This indicates dimensional correctness."
