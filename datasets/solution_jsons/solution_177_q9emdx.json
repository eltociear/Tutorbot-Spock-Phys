    "Question": "7: A vertical off-shore structure is built to withstand maximum stress of 109 Pa. Is the structure suitable for putting up on top of an oil well in the ocean? Take the depth of the ocean to be roughly 3 km, and ignore ocean currents.\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nThe maximum stress the structure can handle, P = 10^9 Pa\r\nDepth of the sea, d = 3 km = 3 \u00d7 10^3 m  Density of water, \u03c1 = 10^3 kg/m^3\r\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m/s^2\r\nWe know\r\nThe pressure exerted by the seawater at depth, d = \u03c1dg = 10^3 x 3 \u00d7 10^3 \u00d7 9.8 = 2.94 \u00d7 10^7 Pa\r\nAs the sea exerts a pressure lesser than the maximum stress the structure can handle, the structure can survive on the oil well in the sea.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given a few pieces of information to begin with. First, we've been told the maximum stress that the offshore structure can endure is 109 Pa. That is, P = 10^9 Pa. Second, we know the depth of the sea where the structure is proposed to be installed is 3km or 3 \u00d7 10^3 m. Additionally, we're given the density of seawater \u03c1 = 10^3 kg/m^3 and the acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m/s^2. Step 2) The next step is understanding the physics involved. The pressure exerted by the seawater at depth, d, is calculated by the formula \u03c1dg. We substitute the given values in the equation, which yields 10^3 x 3 \u00d7 10^3 x 9.8; this calculates to 2.94 \u00d7 10^7 Pa. Step 3) Finally, we compare the pressure exerted by the sea to the maximum stress the structure can handle. If the pressure is lesser, then the structure can withstand the conditions of the sea. We find that 2.94 \u00d7 10^7 Pa (pressure from seawater) is less than 10^9 Pa (maximum stress the structure can take), thus concluding that the structure is indeed suitable for installation on an oil well in the ocean.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values - maximum stress the structure can handle (P = 10^9 Pa), depth of the sea (d = 3 \u00d7 10^3 m), density of seawater (\u03c1 = 10^3 kg/m^3), and acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s^2). Step 2) Apply these values to the formula for calculating the pressure exerted by the seawater at a certain depth, which is \u03c1dg. This formula helps determine if the pressure at that depth will exceed the maximum stress the structure can tolerate. Step 3) Compare the calculated pressure to the maximum stress the structure can handle. If the pressure is lesser, then the structure can withstand the conditions of the sea. The comparison shows whether the offshore structure can safely be installed over the oil well in the ocean."
