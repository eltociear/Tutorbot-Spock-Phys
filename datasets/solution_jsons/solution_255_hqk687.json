    "Question": "Q4. Using the formula v = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho }}\\end{array} \\), explain why the speed of sound in air\r\n(a) does not depend upon pressure.\r\n(b) increases with temperature and humidity.\r\n(c) increases with humidity.",
    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nv = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho }}\\end{array} \\)\r\nWe know,\r\nPV = nRT ( for n moles of ideal gas )\r\nPV = RT (m/M )\r\nWhere, m is the total mass, and M is the molecular mass of the gas.\r\nTherefore, P  = m (RT/M)\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\rho RT}{M}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{P}{\\rho} = \\frac{ RT}{M}\\end{array} \\)\r\n(a) For a gas at a constant temperature,\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{P}{\\rho}\\end{array} \\) = constant\r\nThus, as P increases \u03c1 and vice versa. This means that the P/\u03c1 ratio always remains constant, meaning\r\nv = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho }}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= constant, i.e. velocity of sound does not depend upon the pressure of the gas.\r\n(b) Since, \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{P}{\\rho} = \\frac{ RT}{M}\\end{array} \\)\r\nv = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho }}\\end{array} \\) = v = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma RT}{M }}\\end{array} \\)\r\nWe can see that v \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\propto \\sqrt{T}\\end{array} \\), i.e. speed of sound increases with temperature.\r\n(c) When humidity increases, the effective density of the air decrease. This means \\(\\begin{array}{l}v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho }}\\end{array} \\), thus velocity increases.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides the formula for the velocity of sound in a gas or air, as v = sqrt(\u03b3P/\u03c1). In this formula, 'v' is the velocity of sound, '\u03b3' is the adiabatic index, 'P' is the pressure, and '\u03c1' is the density. Step 2) We begin to solve it by referencing the ideal gas equation: PV = nRT or PV = RT(m/M), where 'n' is number of moles, 'R' is the gas constant, 'T' is the temperature, 'm' is the total mass, and 'M' is the molecular mass of the gas. Step 3) We can rearrange the ideal gas equation to get P = \u03c1RT/M, indicating that the pressure is equal to the density times the gas constant times the temperature over the molecular mass. Step 4) This means that P/\u03c1 = RT/M. Step 5) As for the speed of sound, we can replace P/\u03c1 in the original formula with RT/M, so v = sqrt(\u03b3RT/M). This shows the relationship between the speed of sound, temperature, the gas constant, the adiabatic index, and the molar mass of the gas.  Step 6) In part a) of the problem, if the temperature is held constant, P/\u03c1 becomes a constant, and therefore the speed of sound does not depend on the pressure since an increase in pressure is countered by an increase in density. Step 7) For part b), considering the equation v = sqrt(\u03b3RT/M), we can see that the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the temperature. When temperature increases, the speed of sound does too. Step 8) In part c), when the humidity increases, it actually decreases overall air density due to water vapor (which is less dense than dry air). With our formula v = sqrt(\u03b3P/\u03c1), we can see that as density decreases (i.e., with more humidity), the speed of sound increases.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) The problem stance involves a formula: v = sqrt(\u03b3P/\u03c1) that depicts the velocity of sound. Step 2) We can use an ideal gas law equation to manipulate and understand this formula. Step 3) By doing so, we find that P/\u03c1 = RT/M when rearranged. Step 4) We can substitute this back into the original formula to get v = sqrt(\u03b3RT/M). Step 5) Under constant temperature, P/\u03c1 becomes a constant, showing that pressure does not influence the speed of sound (part a). Step 6) From the derived formula, we understand that the speed of sound increases with temperature (part b), as v is proportional to the square root of T. Step 7) Increased humidity lowers the air density, \u03c1. And when \u03c1 decreases, the velocity increases (part c)."
