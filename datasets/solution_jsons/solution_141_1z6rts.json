    "Question": "7. Does the escape speed of a body from the earth depend on (a) the mass of the body, (b) the location from where it is projected, (c) the direction of projection, (d) the height ofthe location from where the body is launched?",
    "Original Solution": "The escape speed is given by the expression\r\n(a) The escape speed of a body from the Earth does not depend on the mass of the body.\r\n(b) The escape speed of a body from the Earth does not depend on the location from where a body is projected.\r\n(c) The escape speed does not depend on the direction of the projection of a body.\r\n(d) The escape speed of a body depends upon the height of the location from where the body is launched since the escape velocity depends on the gravitational potential at the point from which it is launched. This potential, in turn, depends on the height.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that the escape speed of a body from Earth is given by a specific mathematical expression, derived from principles of physics. This expression incorporates the gravitational constant, the mass of the Earth, and the radius of the Earth. Importantly, note that this expression does not include the mass of the object, the location from which it is projected, or the direction of projection. Step 2) From this understanding, conclude that the escape speed does not depend on the mass of the body being projected. This is because the mass of the body does not appear in our escape speed equation. Step 3) Infer the independence of escape speed from the location of projection; since our formula does not include any terms that would suggest a dependency on the location, we deduce that this factor does not impact escape speed. Step 4) Understand that the formula also doesn't consider the direction of projection, thus we can infer that escape speed is not influenced by this either. Step 5) Consider the impact of the height from where the body is launched, which does play a role in the escape speed. This is due to how gravitational potential energy (included implicitly in our formula) changes with height. The higher up a body is launched from, the lesser the escape speed required, as the body would already have overcome a part of the Earth's gravitational pull.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the formula for escape speed and its variables - Does not include mass of the object, location or direction of projection. Step 2) Conclude that escape speed is independent of the mass of the projected body - the formula doesn't include the mass of the projected body. Step 3) Note that the location where the object is projected from doesn't affect escape speed \u2013 the formula doesn't include this factor. Step 4) Recognize the escape speed doesn't depend on the direction of projection - the formula doesn't account for this either. Step 5) Understand that the height from where the body is launched does influence the escape speed \u2013 This is due to its relation with the gravitational potential energy."
