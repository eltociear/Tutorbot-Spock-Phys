    "Question": "24. A bullet of mass 0.012 kg and horizontal speed 70 m s^(\u20131) strikes a block of wood of mass 0.4 kg and instantly comes to rest with respect to the block. The block is suspended from the ceiling by means of thin wires. Calculate the height to which the block rises. Also, estimate the amount of heat produced in the block.",

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin by identifying the known values. The mass of the bullet m1 is 0.012 kg and its initial speed u1 is 70 m/s. The block of wood's mass m2 is 0.4 kg, and its initial speed u2 is 0. We also know that the final speed of the bullet and the block's combination is v m/s. Step 2) Apply the law of conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the interaction (the parts moving independently) should equal the total momentum after the interaction (the parts moving together). So, m1u1 + m2u2 equals (m1 + m2)v. Given our known values, we can simplify this to (0.012*70) + (0.4*0) equals (0.012 + 0.4)*v. Solving this equation provides v=0.84/0.412, or v = 2.04 m/s. Step 3) Now that we know the final velocity, let's find the height to which the block rises (h). We'll apply the law of conservation of energy, stating that the potential energy at the top of the block's path equals its kinetic energy at the bottom. So, (m1 + m2)gh equals 1/2 (m1 + m2)v^2. From this, we can solve for h = v^2/2g, which simplifies to ((2.04)^2)/2*9.8 (where g is the gravity, 9.8 m/s^2), giving us h = 0.212m. Step 4) Finally, we'll estimate the heat produced. We begin with the initial kinetic energy of the bullet (1/2)m1u1^2 and subtract the final kinetic energy of the bullet and block system (1/2)(m1 + m2)v^2. This gives us (1/2)*0.012*(70)^2  - (1/2)*(0.012 + 0.4)*(2.04^)2, so the heat produced equals 29.4 - 0.857 or 28.54J.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values: the masses and initial speeds of the bullet and block of wood. Step 2) Use the law of conservation of momentum (m1u1 + m2u2 equals (m1 + m2)v) to find the final speed of the combined system. Step 3) Apply the law of conservation of energy to find the height h to which the block rises. The potential energy at the top of its path, (m1 + m2)gh, equals its kinetic energy at the bottom, 1/2 (m1 + m2)v^2. Rearrange to solve for h. Step 4) Calculate the heat produced as the difference between the initial kinetic energy of the bullet and the final kinetic energy of the bullet and wood system."
