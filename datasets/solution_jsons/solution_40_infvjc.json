    "Question": "Q2: From the following, pick any two scalar quantities:\r\nForce, angular momentum, work, current, linear momentum, electric field, average velocity, magnetic moment, relative velocity.",
    "Original Solution": "The dot product of force and displacement is the work done. Work is a scalar quantity since the dot product of two quantities is always scalar.\r\nCurrent is a scalar quantity as it is described only by its magnitude, and it is independent of direction.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) This problem refers to the concept of scalar quantities in physics. These are quantities that are fully described by their magnitude alone and do not involve a direction. In contrast, vector quantities, which are not what you are looking for in this problem, are quantities that are described by both a magnitude and direction. Vector quantities are involved in cases where directionality is important, for example in the application of forces.  Step 2) The first choice given in the solution is 'work'. The reason behind this is that the definition of work involves the dot product of force (a vector quantity) and displacement (another vector quantity). The dot product, also known as the scalar product, results in a scalar quantity, fitting the problem's requirements. This is reflected in the work-energy theorem equation, W = F.d, where W is work done, F is force, and d is displacement. Step 3) The second choice mentioned in the solution is 'current'. This is because electric current, by definition, is simply the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor. It does not depend on the direction of flow. The magnitude of current is given by the formula I = Q/t, where I is current, Q is electric charge and t is time. Therefore, current also qualifies as a scalar quantity as per our discussion in Step 1. So, based on the definitions and properties of work and current, they are both considered scalar quantities.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the concept of scalar quantities, which are quantities that are described only by their magnitude and not by their direction. Step 2) Identify 'work' as a suitable scalar quantity. This is because the work done is obtained through the dot product (scalar product) of force and displacement, both vectors, and yields work, a scalar quantity. This relationship is encapsulated in the work-energy theorem. Step 3) Recognize 'current' as another appropriate scalar quantity. The magnitude of current is the rate of the flow of electric charge, which is independent of the direction of flow. This can be expressed using the formula for electric current. Therefore, work and current are both examples of scalar quantities."
