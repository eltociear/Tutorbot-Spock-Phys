Take the radius of a nitrogen molecule to be roughly 1.0 \u00c5. Compare the collision time with the time the molecule moves freely between two successive collisions (Molecular mass of N2 = 28.0 u).",
    "Original Solution": "Mean free path = 1.11 x 10^(-7) m\r\nCollision frequency = 4.58 x 10^9 s^-1\r\nSuccessive collision time \u2245 500 x (Collision time)\r\nThe pressure inside the cylinder containing nitrogen, P = 2.0 atm = 2.026 x 10^5 Pa\r\nThe temperature inside the cylinder, T = 170 C = 290 K\r\nThe radius of a nitrogen molecule, r = 1.0 \u00c5 = 1 x 10^10 m\r\nDiameter, d = 2 x 1 x 10^10 = 2 x 10^10 m\r\nThe molecular mass of nitrogen, M = 28.0 g = 28 x 10^(-3) kg\r\nThe root mean square speed of nitrogen is given by the relation\r\nVrms= \u221a3RT / M\r\nWhere, R is the universal gas constant = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1\r\nHence, Vrms= 3 x 8.314 x 290 / 28 x 10^(-3) = 508.26 m/s\r\nThe mean free path (l) is given by the relation\r\nl = KT / \u221a2 x \u03c0 x d^2 x P\r\nWhere,\r\nk is the Boltzmann constant = 1.38 x 10^(-23) kg m^2 s^-2 K^-1\r\nHence,\r\nl = (1.38 x 10^(-23) x 290) / (\u221a2 x 3.14 x (2 x 10^(-10))^2 x 2.026 x 10^5\r\n= 1.11 x 10^(-7) m\r\nCollision frequency = Vrms / l = 508.26 / 1.11 x 10^(-7) = 4.58 x 10^9 s^-1\r\nThe collision time is given as\r\nT = d / Vrms\r\n= 2 x 10^(-10) / 508.26\r\n= 3.93 x 10^(-13) s\r\nTime taken between successive collisions\r\nT\u2019 = l / Vrms = 1.11 x 10^(-7) / 508.26\r\n= 2.18 x 10^(-10)\r\nHence,\r\nT\u2019 / T = 2.18 x 10^(-10) / (3.93 x 10^(-13)) = 500\r\nTherefore, the time taken between successive collisions is 500 times the time taken for a collision.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by defining all known values from the problem. The pressure inside the cylinder containing nitrogen, P, is given as 2.0 atm which must be converted to the SI unit of Pascal (Pa), using 1 atm = 1.013 x 10^5 Pa. Hence, P = 2.0 x 1.013 x 10^5 = 2.026 x 10^5 Pa. The temperature inside the cylinder, T, is given as 170 C which must also be converted to the SI unit of Kelvin (K), using the relation T(K) = T(C) + 273.15. Therefore, T = 170 + 273.15 = 290 K. The radius of a nitrogen molecule, r, is given as 1.0 \u00c5, which needs to be converted into the SI unit of a meter (m) using the relation 1 \u00c5 = 10^(-10) m. So, r = 1.0 x 10^(-10) m. \n\nStep 2) We calculate the diameter, d, of the nitrogen molecule which is twice of its radius, d = 2r = 2 x 1 x 10^(-10) = 2 x 10^(-10) m.\n\nStep 3) The molecular mass of nitrogen, M, is given as 28.0 g which we convert to the SI unit of kilograms (kg) using the relation 1 g = 10^(-3) kg. Hence M = 28 x 10^(-3) kg.\n\nStep 4) We calculate the root mean square speed, Vrms, of the nitrogen molecules using the relation Vrms = \u221a(3RT / M), where, R is the universal gas constant = 8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1. Upon substituting the known values into this equation, we get Vrms = \u221a(3 x 8.314 x 290 / (28 x 10^-3)) = 508.26 m/s.\n\nStep 5) We calculate the mean free path (l) using the relation l = kT / \u221a(2 x \u03c0 x d^2 x P), where k is the Boltzmann constant = 1.38 x 10^(-23) kg m^2 s^-2 K^-1. By substituting the known values into this equation, we get l = (1.38 x 10^(-23) x 290) / (\u221a2 x 3.14 x (2 x 10^(-10))^2 x 2.026 x 10^5) = 1.11 x 10^(-7) m.\n\nStep 6) We calculate the collision frequency = Vrms / l, with Vrms and l values from our previous steps, to get the collision frequency = 508.26 / 1.11 x 10^(-7) = 4.58 x 10^9 s^-1.\n\nStep 7) We calculate the collision time using T = d / Vrms. By substituting the known values, T = 2 x 10^(-10) / 508.26 = 3.93 x 10^(-13) s.\n\nStep 8) We calculate time taken between successive collisions, T\u2019, using T' = l / Vrms. Substituting the values, we get T' = 1.11 x 10^(-7) / 508.26 = 2.18 x 10^(-10) s.\n\nStep 9) Finally, we compare these two times using T' / T = 2.18 x 10^(-10) / 3.93 x 10^(-13) = 500. Hence, the time taken between successive collisions is 500 times the time taken for a single collision.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Define all known values including conversion to SI units. This includes pressure 'P', temperature 'T', radius 'r' and molecular mass 'M'.\n\nStep 2) Calculate the diameter 'd' of a nitrogen molecule by multiplying the radius by 2.\n\nStep 3) Use the given molecular mass to convert from grams to kilograms.\n\nStep 4) Use the equation Vrms = \u221a(3RT / M) to calculate the root mean square speed of the nitrogen molecules. Here Vrms, is a measure of the average speed of the molecules.\n\nStep 5) Use the equation l = kT / \u221a(2 x \u03c0 x d^2 x P) to calculate the mean free path, which represents the average distance the molecule travels before colliding with another molecule.\n\nStep 6) Divide Vrms by l to find the collision frequency, which gives the rate at which the molecule collides with others.\n\nStep 7) Use the equation T = d / Vrms to calculate the collision time. This is the average time it takes for a single molecule to make a collision.\n\nStep 8) Similarly, use the equation T' = l / Vrms to find the time taken between successive collisions.\n\nStep 9) Finally, compare the time of a single collision with the time taken between successive collisions."
