    "Question": "12: Does it matter if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressures in applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation? Explain.",
    "Original Solution": "No, it does not matter if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressures in applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation, provided the atmospheric pressure at the two points where Bernoulli\u2019s equation applied to the system is significantly different.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with addressing the concept of pressure, specifically the two types of pressure in question - gauge and absolute pressure. Gauge pressure is the pressure measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, whereas absolute pressure is the pressure measured with respect to a perfect vacuum (zero pressure) Step 2) We then bring into focus Bernoulli's equation which is essentially a statement of the conservation of energy principle for flowing fluids. It accounts for gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, and fluid pressure. Step 3) To answer the question as to whether it matters if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressure in applying Bernoulli's equation, we should recall that Bernoulli's equation is generally applied between two points within a fluid flow where pressure, velocity, and elevation might be different, but where the sum of their contributions to the total energy of the fluid remains constant. Step 4) In applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation, as long as the pressure difference between the two points is the same, the equation holds, regardless of whether the pressures used are gauge or absolute. If the atmospheric pressure is the same at both points, the gauge pressures and absolute pressures will differ by a constant value (the value of the atmospheric pressure) at both points, so the pressure difference remains the same. Step 5) Hence, it follows that it does not matter if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressures in applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation, provided the atmospheric pressure at the two points where the equation is applied remain the same. This is because the change in pressure, which is what's important in Bernoulli's equation, is independent of whether gauge or absolute pressures are used.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the differential concept of gauge and absolute pressure. Step 2) Understand Bernoulli's equation as a manifestation of the conservation of energy for fluid dynamics which accounts for changes in pressure, velocity, and elevation within a fluid system. Step 3) Apprehend the concept of Bernoulli's equation being applied between two points in the fluid flow. The important factor is the difference in pressure between these two points. The sum of their contributions to the total energy does not change. Step 4) Understand that gauge and absolute pressures at both points will differ by a constant value (atmospheric pressure), therefore maintaining a constant pressure difference regardless of the type of pressure used. Step 5) Conclude that it does not matter whether gauge or absolute pressures are used to apply Bernoulli\u2019s equation as long as the atmospheric pressure at both points involved in the equation remains the same."
