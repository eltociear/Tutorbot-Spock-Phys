    "Question": "5: A 50 kg girl wearing high heel shoes balances on a single heel. The heel is circular with a diameter of 1.0 cm. What is the pressure exerted by the heel on the horizontal floor? \r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nRadius of the heel, r = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ d }{ 2 }\\end{array} \\) = 0.005 m\r\nMass of the lady, m = 50 kg\r\nArea of the heel, A = \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0 (0.005)^2= 7.85 \u00d7 10^(-5) m^2\r\nForce on the floor due to the heel, F = mg = 50 \u00d7 9.8 = 490 N\r\nThe pressure exerted by the heel on the floor,\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ F }{ A }\\end{array} \\)  = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 490 }{  7.85 \\times  10^{ -5 }}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}6.24 \\times 10^{ 6 }\\end{array} \\) Nm^(-2)",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the values provided by the problem. We know that the lady's mass (m) is 50 kg, her heel is circular with a diameter of 1.0 cm, and we know the acceleration due to gravity (g) is always approximately 9.8 m/s^2. \n\nStep 2) We start with the radius (r) of the heel, which is not directly given. Since we are given the diameter (d) and radius is half the diameter, we use the formula r = d/2. Here, diameter is 1.0 cm which we convert to meters (noting the 100 cm = 1 m conversion), giving r = 0.005 m.\n\nStep 3) Next, we calculate the area (A) of the circular heel. The formula is A = \u03c0r^2. Here radius (r) is 0.005 m, so, A = \u03c0 (0.005)^2 = 7.85 x 10^(-5) m^2. This gives us the area in square meters.\n\nStep 4) Now we calculate the force (F) exerted by the lady on the ground. Since all her weight is on the heel, that gives us a force calculated by multiplying her mass (m) by the acceleration due to gravity (g). That is, F = mg = 50 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 = 490 N (Newtons).\n\nStep 5) Finally, we find the pressure (P) exerted by the heel. Pressure is force per unit area, P = F/A. We substitute the values of F and A from the previous steps to find the pressure. P = 490 N / 7.85 x 10^(-5) m^2 = 6.24 x 10^6 N/m^2 (Pascal) extended by heel on the floor.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values: lady's mass (m), heel diameter (d), and acceleration due to gravity (g).\n\nStep 2) Calculate the radius (r) of the heel from given diameter using the formula, r = d/2.\n\nStep 3) Calculate the area (A) of the heel bottom using the formula for the area of a circle A = \u03c0r^2.\n\nStep 4) Calculate the force (F) exerted by the lady on the floor using the formula F = mg, where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nStep 5) The pressure (P) exerted by the heel on the floor is calculated by dividing the force exerted by the lady by the area of the heel, using P = F/A."
