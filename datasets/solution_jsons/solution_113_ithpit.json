    "Question": "23. A family uses 8 kW of power. (a) Direct solar energy is incident on the horizontal surface at an average rate of 200 W per square meter. If 20% of this energy can be converted to useful electrical energy, how large an area is needed to supply 8 kW?(b) Compare this area to that of the roof of a typical house.",
    "Original Solution": "(a) Power used by the family, p = 8 KW = 8000 W\r\nSolar energy received per square metre = 200 W/m^2\r\nPercentage of energy converted to useful electrical energy = 20%\r\nAs solar energy is incident at a rate of 200 Wm^(-2)\r\nThe area required to generate the desired energy is A.\r\nUseful electrical energy produced per second\r\n=  (20/100) A x 200 = 8000\r\nA= 4000 W/200 Wm^(-2) =200 m^2\r\n(b) The area needed is comparable to the roof of a large house of dimension 14m \u00d7 14m.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem starts by providing the power usage of a family, which is 8 kW. But to work with the units in the problem, we need to convert this power into watts. This amounts to P = 8 kW = 8000 W. Having the same units is important in order to correctly apply formulas and calculate the results. \n\nStep 2) Next, we know that the solar energy is incident at a rate of 200 W per square meter (W/m^2). This information tells us how much solar energy is received in a specific area.\n\nStep 3) We also know that 20% of this incident solar energy can be converted into useful electrical energy. This percentage is our efficiency factor which tells us how effectively we convert the inherent solar energy into usable power. \n\nStep 4) Now, to find the required area, we need to focus on how much useful electrical energy is produced per unit area per second. We can calculate this by multiplying the total solar energy received per unit area by the efficiency of the energy conversion. Therefore, useful electrical energy produced per second would be = (200 W/m^2) * (20/100) = 40 W/m^2.\n\nStep 5) Finally, equate the power used by the family (8000 W) to the useful electrical energy produced per second, and solve for the area (A). So we have (40 W/m^2) * A = 8000 W, which gives us A= 8000 W / 40 W/m^2 = 200 m^2. \n\nStep 6) By comparing this area with that of a large house, we find that it is roughly the same as the area covered by a roof of a house with dimensions of approximately 14m by 14m.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert the given power usage of the family to watts from kilowatts. \n\nStep 2) Identify the given rate at which solar energy is incident per square meter. \n\nStep 3) Determine the efficiency at which the incident solar energy can be converted into useful electrical energy. \n\nStep 4) Calculate the useful electrical energy produced per second per square meter, by multiplying the solar energy received per square meter by the energy conversion efficiency. \n\nStep 5) Finally, by equating the power used by the family to the useful energy produced per second, calculate the total area required by isolating 'A' in the equation. \n\nStep 6) For a practical understanding, compare this calculated area to the roof of a typical house."
