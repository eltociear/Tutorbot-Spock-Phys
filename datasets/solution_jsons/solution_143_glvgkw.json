    "Question": "9. Which of the following symptoms is likely to afflict an astronaut in space (a) swollen feet, (b) swollen face, (c) headache, (d) orientational problem.",
    "Original Solution": "(a). In zero gravity, the blood flow to the feet isn\u2019t increased, so the astronaut does not get swollen feet.\r\n(b). There is more supply of blood to the face of the astronaut. Therefore, the astronaut will have a swollen face.\r\n(c). Due to increased blood supply to their faces, astronauts can be affected by headaches.\r\n(d). Space has different orientations, so orientational problems can affect an astronaut.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Analyze the first symptom: swollen feet. In zero gravity, the gravitational pull towards the earth's surface is absent. Normally, gravity contributes to pulling blood down towards our feet, but in space, this doesn't happen. Thus, an astronaut in space does not experience an increasing blood supply to the feet, preventing feet from swelling. Step 2) Examine the second symptom: swollen face. In contrast to Earth, where gravity pulls much of our blood downwards, in space, blood tends to flow towards the upper body and head. As a result, the face receives a more significant blood supply, leading to swelling. Step 3) Consider the third symptom: headache. Increased blood supply to the face isn't just noticeable in terms of outward swelling. This situation can also cause pressure internally, leading to possible headaches. Step 4) Evaluate the final symptom: orientation problem. Space lacks a defined 'up' or 'down,' which is typically provided by gravity. Without this consistent sense of direction, astronauts must depend on visual cues to maintain orientation, which can lead to confusion or disorientation.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Consideration of swollen feet - here, we comprehend how the lack of gravity in space reduces blood flow to the feet, preventing them from swelling. Step 2) Analysis of swollen face - this stage entails understanding how the absence of gravitational pull on blood allows more blood to flow towards the face, causing it to swell. Step 3) Consideration of headache - due to the increased blood flow in the upper body, when in space, this can induce headaches. Step 4) Evaluation of orientation problem - since space has a different sense of direction, astronauts may experience orientational issues, mostly due to the lack of natural 'up' or 'down.'"
