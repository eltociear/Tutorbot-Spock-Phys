    "Question": "2.9 . The photograph of a house occupies an area of 1.75 cm2 on a 35 mm slide. The slide is projected onto a screen, and the area of the house on the screen is 1.55 m2. What is the linear magnification of the projector-screen arrangement?",
    "Original Solution": "Arial Magnification = Area of the image/Area of the object\r\n= 1.55/1.75 x 10^4\r\n= 8.857x 10^3\r\nLinear Magnification = \u221aArial magnification\r\n= \u221a(8.857x 10^3) \r\n= 94. 1",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In this problem we're given the area of the image of a house on a slide and the area of the same image projected onto a screen. We know that the area of the image on the slide is 1.75 cm2, and the area of the image on the screen is 1.55 m2. Step 2) We're asked to find the linear magnification, which is the square root of the area magnification. The first step is to find the area magnification. We do this by taking the ratio of the area of the image on the screen to the area of the image on the slide, which equals 1.55 m2 / 1.75 cm2. Step 3) Note that we want to make sure we're working in the same unit before we do our calculations. Since 1 m = 1 x 10^2 cm, we convert 1.55 m2 to cm2 by multiplying by (1 x 10^2)^2, giving us a result of 1.55 x 10^4 cm2. Step 4) We now take the ratio of these two areas to find the area magnification. This gives us 1.55 x 10^4 cm2 / 1.75 cm2 = 8.857 x 10^3. Step 5) To find the linear magnification, we take the square root of the area magnification. So, the linear magnification is \u221a(8.857x 10^3) = 94.1. This means that the length of the house on the screen is 94.1 times larger than it is on the slide.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We're given the area of an image on a slide and the area of the same image projected onto a screen. We're asked to find the linear magnification between these two images. Step 2) First, we need to find the area magnification, which is calculated by taking the ratio of the area of the image on the screen to the area of the image on the slide. However, we need to make sure we're using the same units in our calculations, so we convert the area in m2 to cm2. Step 3) With both areas in the same units, we divide the area of the image on the screen by the area of the image on the slide to find the area magnification. Step 4) The linear magnification is the square root of the area magnification. So, we take the square root of the value we found in the last step to get our final answer."
