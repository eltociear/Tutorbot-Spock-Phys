    "Question": "Q5.We know that the function y = f (x, t) represents a wave travelling in one direction, where x and t must appear in the combination x + vt or x\u2013 vt or, i.e. y = f (x \u00b1 vt). Is the converse true?\r\nCan the following functions for y possibly represent a travelling wave:\r\n(i) (x \u2013 vt) 2\r\n(ii) log [ ( x + vt)/ x0 ]\r\n(iii) 1 / (x + vt )",
    "Original Solution": "No, the converse is not true because it is necessary for a wave function representing a travelling wave to have a finite value for all values of x and t.\r\nAs none of the above functions satisfies the given condition, none of the options represents a travelling wave.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by reminding ourselves that a function y = f (x, t) represents a wave travelling in one direction, where x and t must appear in the combination x + vt or x\u2013 vt, i.e. y = f (x \u00b1 vt). For the converse to be true, any function following these patterns should represent a travelling wave.\nStep 2) Let's examine the stated condition that a wave function representing a travelling wave should have a finite value for all values of x and t. This implies that as we traverse along the wave, no matter at which point we are (defined by the values of x and t), the wave function should have a valid, finite value.\nStep 3) Let's apply this condition to the given functions one by one. For the first function, (x \u2013 vt)^2, it's clear that this function can attain all values from zero to +infinity, but never less than zero. Thus, it doesn't satisfy the condition.\nStep 4) For the second function, log [ ( x + vt)/ x0 ], the logarithm would be undefined if ( x + vt)/ x0 goes below or equals zero. Therefore, this function also doesn't satisfy the given condition.\nStep 5) For the last function, 1 / (x + vt ), the reciprocal would be undefined if (x + vt) equals zero. Thus, it also doesn't satisfy the given condition.\nStep 6) Since none of the provided functions satisfy the conditions for a travelling wave, the given functions do not represent travelling waves.\nStep 7) So, we conclude that the converse is not true, not every function which follows the x \u00b1 vt pattern necessarily represents a travelling wave.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We restate that for a function to represent a travelling wave, x and t have to appear in the pattern x \u00b1 vt, forming y = f (x \u00b1 vt).\nStep 2) We understand that a wave function should have a finite value for all values of x and t.\nStep 3) Check whether the first function (x \u2013 vt) 2 has finite value for all x and t. It does not, since it can't go below zero.\nStep 4) Check the second function, log [ ( x + vt)/ x0 ]. It doesn't qualify due to the fact that the logarithm can become undefined.\nStep 5) Examine the third function, 1 / (x + vt ). It fails since the reciprocal becomes undefined when the denominator equals zero.\nStep 6) None of the functions are valid wave functions as per the given conditions.\nStep 7) We conclude that the converse, i.e., all functions following the x \u00b1 vt pattern representing a travelling wave, is not necessarily true."
