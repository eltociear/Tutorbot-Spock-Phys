    "Question": "2.8. Answer the following :\r\n(a) You are given a thread and a metre scale. How will you estimate the diameter of\r\nthe thread?\r\n(b) A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do\r\nyou think it is possible to arbitrarily increase the accuracy of the screw gauge by\r\nincreasing the number of divisions on the circular scale?\r\n(c) The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by vernier callipers. Why\r\nis a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable\r\nestimate than a set of 5 measurements only?",
    "Original Solution": "(a) The thread should be wrapped around a pencil a number of times to form a coil having its turns touching each other closely. Measure the length of this coil with a metre scale. If L be the length of the coil and n be the number of turns of the coil, then the diameter of the thread is given by the relation\r\nDiameter = L/n.\r\n(b) Least count of the screw gauge = Pitch/number of divisions on the circular scale\r\nSo, theoretically, when the number of divisions on the circular scale is increased, the least count of the screw gauge will decrease. Hence, the accuracy of the screw gauge will increase. However, this is only a theoretical idea. Practically, there will be many other difficulties when the number of turns is increased.\r\n(c)  The probability of making random errors can be reduced to a larger extent in 100 observations than in the case of 5 observations.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) In order to estimate the diameter of a thread, it should be uniformly wound onto a cylindrical object such as a pencil, ensuring that each subsequent turn, or coil, of the thread is closely touching the previous one. The uniformity and closeness of each turn is important to avoid any errors in calculation due to looseness or variations in the coils' distances. Step 2) Once we have a neatly wound coil, its total length, L, is measured using a metre scale. Make sure to measure from the start to end of the coil. Step 3) We also need to count the total number of turns, n, in the coil. Step 4) Using the formula Diameter = L/n, the diameter of the thread can be calculated by dividing the total length of the coil by the number of turns. This method is based on the circular nature of the wound thread where the diameter would equal to the length of one complete turn. Step 5) When it comes to a screw gauge, the accuracy of the instrument can be quantified using its least count, which is the minimum possible measurement that can be made. This is calculated by dividing the pitch of the screw gauge by the number of divisions on the circular scale. Step 6) In theory, by increasing the number of divisions on the circular scale, the least count of the screw gauge would decrease thereby increasing the accuracy. However, in practice, as more divisions are added, physical limitations such as readability and precision in marking the divisions may pose challenges. Step 7) In case of measuring the diameter of a thin brass rod using vernier calipers, it is statistically advisable to take more repeated measurements. When more measurements, say 100 as opposed to 5, are taken the probability of the mean diameter getting affected by random errors is reduced. The larger the sample size, the more reliable the estimate becomes, as it helps in nullifying accidental errors which may have crept in during the observation process.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Wrap the thread around a pencil uniformly to form a coil. Step 2) Measure the length, L, of the coil using a meter scale. Step 3) Count the number of turns, n, in the coil. Step 4) Calculate the diameter using the equation Diameter = L/n. Step 5) Understand that the least count of a screw gauge, which determines its accuracy, is calculated by Pitch/Total divisions on the scale. Step 6) Realize that although theoretically increasing the divisions on the scale can increase the accuracy, practical considerations limit this increase. Step 7) Learning that more repeated measurements (100 vs 5) of the rod's diameter using vernier calipers increase reliability of results as it reduces the impact of random errors."
