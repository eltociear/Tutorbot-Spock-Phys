    "Question": "3. Explain why \r\n(a) Two bodies at different temperatures T1 and T2 if brought in thermal contact, do not necessarily settle to the mean temperature (T1 + T2)/2. \r\n(b) The coolant in a chemical or a nuclear plant (i.e., the liquid used to prevent the different parts of a plant from getting too hot) should have high specific heat. \r\n(c) Air pressure in a car tyre increases during driving. \r\n(d) The climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude.",
    "Original Solution": "(i). When two bodies having different temperatures, say T1 and T2 are brought in thermal contact with each other, there is a flow of heat from the body at the higher temperature to the body at the lower temperature till both the bodies reach an equilibrium position, i.e., both the bodies are having equal temperature. The equilibrium temperature is only equal to the mean temperature when the thermal capacities of both the bodies are equal.\r\n(ii).The coolant used in a chemical or nuclear plant should always have a high specific heat. Higher is the specific heat of the coolant, higher is its capacity to absorb heat and release heat. Therefore, a liquid with a high specific heat value is the best coolant to be used in a nuclear or chemical plant. This would prevent different parts of the plant from getting too hot.\r\n(iii). When the driver is driving a vehicle then due to the motion of air molecules the air temperature inside the tyre increases. And according to the Charles\u2019 law, the temperature is directly proportional to pressure.\r\nTherefore, when the temperature inside a tyre increases, then there is also an increase of air pressure.\r\n(iv). The relative humidity in a harbour town is more than that of the relative humidity in a desert town. Humidity is a measure of water vapor in the atmosphere and the specific heat of water vapor is very high. Therefore, the climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) For part (a), we start by understanding the basic principle that heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature until equilibrium is reached, which is when both bodies have the same temperature. This is a fundamental law of thermodynamics.\nStep 2) The equilibrium temperature, however, may not be equal to the mean temperature (T1 + T2)/2. The reason is that the thermal capacities of both bodies must be considered as well. If the two bodies have identical thermal capacities, then the equilibrium temperature will indeed be the mean temperature. But if they differ, the equilibrium temperature will shift towards the temperature of the body with larger thermal capacity. This is because the body with a larger thermal capacity can absorb or release more heat before its temperature changes significantly.\nStep 3) For part (b), the choice of coolant in chemical or nuclear plants is crucial. A coolant with a high specific heat is preferred. The specific heat of a substance reflects its ability to absorb heat. So, a coolant with a higher specific heat can absorb more heat without its temperature rising excessively, thus effectively controlling the temperature of various parts of the plant.\nStep 4) For part (c), we can refer to Charles' law which states that the volume of a gas increases with its temperature if the pressure and the amount of gas remain constant. However, in a car tyre, the volume is fixed. Consequently, if the temperature rises (due to the motion of air molecules brought about by driving), the pressure has to increase to maintain the constant volume. Hence, the air pressure in a car tyre increases during driving.\nStep 5) In part (d), we discuss why a harbour town has a more temperate climate compared to a desert town at the same latitude. A key factor lies in their relative humidity - the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Harbour towns generally have a high relative humidity due to their proximity to large bodies of water. Water has a high specific heat, meaning it can absorb or release a large amount of heat before its temperature changes significantly. Therefore, the large amount of water vapor in the air helps to moderate temperature fluctuations, resulting in a more temperate climate.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) For Part (a), we analyze the flow of heat between two bodies with different temperatures until they reach equilibrium. We note that the equilibrium temperature is not necessarily the mean temperature of the two bodies, unless their thermal capacities are equal.\nStep 2) For Part (b), we understand the role of the coolant in a chemical or a nuclear plant. We highlight the importance of having a coolant with high specific heat, so it can absorb large amounts of heat and prevent the plant from overheating.\nStep 3) For Part (c), we discuss the connection between the rising air temperature in a car tyre during driving and the subsequent increase in air pressure, referencing Charles' law.\nStep 4) For Part (d), we examine the reason a harbour town has a more temperate climate than a desert town at the same latitude, focusing on the role of relative humidity and the specific heat of water in modulating temperature fluctuations."
