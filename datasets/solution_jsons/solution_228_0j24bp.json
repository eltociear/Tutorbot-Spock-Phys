    "Question": "8. Three vessels of equal capacity have gases at the same temperature and pressure. The first vessel contains neon (monatomic), the second contains chlorine (diatomic), and the third contains uranium hexafluoride (polyatomic). Do the vessels contain an equal number of respective molecules? Is the root mean square speed of molecules the same in the three cases? If not, in which case are Vrms the largest?",
    "Original Solution": "All three vessels have the same capacity, they have the same volume.\r\nSo, each gas has the same pressure, volume and temperature.\r\nAccording to Avogadro\u2019s law, the three vessels will contain an equal number of the respective molecules.\r\nThis number is equal to Avogadro\u2019s number, N = 6.023 x 10^23\r\nThe root mean square speed (Vrms) of a gas of mass m and temperature T is given by the relation\r\nVrms = \u221a3kT / m\r\nWhere,\r\nk is the Boltzmann constant.\r\nFor the given gases, k and T are constants.\r\nTherefore, Vrms depends only on the mass of the atoms, i.e., Vrms \u221d (1/m)1/2\r\nHence, the root mean square speed of the molecules in the three cases is not the same.\r\nAmong neon, chlorine and uranium hexafluoride, the mass of neon is the smallest.\r\nTherefore, neon has the largest root mean square speed among the given gases.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we know that the three vessels are of the same capacity, meaning they have the same volume. Also, the gases they contain exist at the same temperature and pressure. This tells us that all three conditions are all equally met for all three gases. Step 2) According to Avogadro\u2019s law, equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, will contain an equal number of molecules. So, yes, the three vessels will contain an equal number of the respective molecules. This number is equal to Avogadro's number, which is N = 6.023 x 10^23. Step 3) To find the root mean square speed (Vrms) for the gasses, we can use the equation Vrms = \u221a3kT / m where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and m the mass of the atoms. Here, k and T are the constants since they are same for all three gases. Step 4) However, Vrms depends only on the mass of the atoms, which is why we write Vrms \u221d (1/m)1/2. The different gases have different atomic masses and as such, the Vrms for each gas will not be the same. Step 5) In comparing the masses of neon, chlorine and uranium hexafluoride, we find that neon has the smallest mass. Because of the inverse relationship between mass and Vrms, Neon, with the smallest mass, will have the largest root mean square speed among the gases.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Take note of the same capacity of the vessels, and the identical temperature and pressure conditions for the gases in them. Step 2) Apply Avogadro\u2019s law to realize that, due to these same conditions, each vessel contains the same number of molecules, equal to Avogadro\u2019s number (N=6.023 x 10^23). Step 3) Use the formula for root mean square speed Vrms = \u221a3kT / m to explore the speeds of these molecules. Note that k (Boltzmann constant) and T (Temperature) are constants with equal values for all gases. Step 4) Understand that Vrms \u221d (1/m)1/2, thus root mean square speeds differ between gases because their atomic masses differ. Step 5) Realize that, due to the inverse relationship between m (mass) and Vrms, the gas with the smallest atomic mass, in this case Neon, has the highest root mean square speed."
