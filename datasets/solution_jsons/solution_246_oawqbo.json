    "Question": "19. One end of a U-tube containing mercury is connected to a suction pump and the other end to atmosphere. A small pressure difference is maintained between the two columns. Show that, when the suction pump is removed, the column of mercury in the U-tube executes simple harmonic motion.",
    "Original Solution": "Area of cross-section of the U-tube = A\r\nDensity of the mercury column = \u03c1\r\nAcceleration due to gravity = g\r\nRestoring force, F = Weight of the mercury column of a certain height\r\nF = \u2013 (Volume x Density x g)\r\nF = \u2013 (A x 2h x \u03c1 x g)\r\n= \u2013 2A\u03c1gh\r\n= \u2013 k x Displacement in one of the arms (h)\r\nWhere,\r\n2h is the height of the mercury column in the two arms\r\nk is a constant, given by\r\nk = \u2013 F / h\r\nWe get,\r\nk = 2A\u03c1g\r\nTime period, T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(m / k)\r\nOn substituting k value, we get,\r\nTime period, T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(m / 2A\u03c1g)\r\nWhere,\r\nm is the mass of the mercury column\r\nLet l be the length of the total mercury in the U-tube\r\nMass of mercury, m = volume of mercury x Density of mercury\r\n= Al\u03c1\r\nHence,\r\nT = 2\u03c0 \u221a(Al\u03c1 / 2A\u03c1g)\r\nT = 2\u03c0 \u221a(l / 2g)\r\nTherefore, the mercury column executes simple harmonic motion with time period 2\u03c0 \u221a(l / 2g)",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) To start solving this problem, we first need to establish the known variables. The area of cross-section of the U-tube is denoted as A, the density of the mercury column is \u03c1, and the acceleration due to gravity is g. Step 2) The restoring force, F, is equated to the weight of the mercury column of a particular height. This is because once the suction pump is removed, any equilibrium established will be disturbed and as the system tries to return to its equilibrium position, a restoring force manifests. Step 3) The weight of the mercury column is calculated by multiplying the Volume by Density and then by gravity, symbolized as (Volume x Density x g). Step 4) The volume is then replaced by A x 2h (where 2h is the height of the mercury column in the two arms of the U-tube), which gives us a new force equation F = - 2A\u03c1gh. Step 5) Linking this restoring force with the displacement of one arm of the U-tube, F equates to \u2013 k x Displacement in one of the arms (h) where k is a constant. Step 6) Solve for the value of k. When we isolate k, its value is 2A\u03c1g. Step 7) The time period, T, is then calculated using the equation T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(m / k), where m is the mass of the mercury column. Step 8) Substituting the value of k into the time period equation, we have T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(m / 2A\u03c1g). Step 9) Calculate the mass m of mercury, given by volume of mercury multiplied by Density of mercury, which equals Al\u03c1, where l is the total length of total mercury in the U-tube. Step 10) Consequently, we rearrange and substitute this mass into the time period calculation, rendering T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(Al\u03c1 / 2A\u03c1g). Step 11) This simplifies further, giving the final time period as T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(l / 2g), which, in the context of physics, indicates that the mercury column executes simple harmonic motion.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the given values: A, \u03c1, and g. Step 2) Determine the restoring force, F, by equating it to the weight of the mercury column of a certain height. Step 3) Express the weight of the mercury column as the product of volume, density, and gravity. Step 4) Replace volume in the force equation with A x 2h, yielding the new force equation F = - 2A\u03c1gh. Step 5) Relate this force with displacement, yielding F = - k x h. Step 6) Isolate the constant, k, yielding the value as 2A\u03c1g. Step 7) Use the equation T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(m / k) to calculate the time period, T. Step 8) Substitute the value of k into the equation. Step 9) Determine the mass, m, of the mercury column as Al\u03c1. Step 10) Substitute this value to find the time period. Step 11) The final time period T = 2\u03c0 \u221a(l / 2g) indicates that the mercury column demonstrates simple harmonic motion."
