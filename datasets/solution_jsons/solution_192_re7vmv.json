    "Original Solution": "(a). We know that rate of decrease of density \u03c1 of air is directly proportional to the height y.\r\ni.e., \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ d \\rho }{ d y } = \\;- \\frac{ \\rho }{ y_{ 0 }}\\end{array} \\) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 1 )Where y is the constant of proportionality and the \u2013ve sign indicates the decrease in density with an increase in height.\r\nIntegrating equation (1), we get \r\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\int_{\\rho _{0}}^{\\rho }\\frac{d}{\\rho } =\\; \u2013 \\int_{0}^{y } \\frac{1}{y_{0}}dy\\\\\\end{array} \\)\r\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}[log \\rho ]_{\\rho _{0}}^{\\rho } = -[\\frac{y}{y_{0}}]_{0}^{y}\\end{array} \\)\r\nWhere \u03c10 = density of air at sea level, i.e., y =0\r\nOr, loge(\u03c10 /\u03c1 ) = -y/y0Therefore, \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\rho =\\rho _{0}\\;e^{\\frac{y}{y_{0}}}\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\n(b).

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we need to understand the given problem. It relates the rate of decrease in the density of the air with the increase in the height. It utilizes the law of atmospheres which states that the density of air decreases as the height increases and this decrease is modeled as an exponential decay. Mathematically, this is expressed as d\u03c1/dy = - \u03c1/y0. The negative sign signifies that as y (height) increases, \u03c1 (density) decreases. y0 here is the characteristic height, or the height at which the density reduces to 1/e (approximately 0.3679) of its original value. \n\nStep 2) Next, note that this is a first-order differential equation in \u03c1. To solve such differential equations, we can separate variables and integrate. In this case, we integrate the expression d\u03c1/\u03c1 from \u03c10 (density at sea level) to \u03c1 (density at height y) and dy/y0 from 0 (sea level) to y (the height where density \u03c1 is measured). \n\nStep 3) After integration, we have [loge \u03c1] evaluated from \u03c10 to \u03c1 = -(y/y0). The left side after evaluation becomes loge (\u03c1 / \u03c10). Setting it equal to the right side gives us loge (\u03c10 / \u03c1) = y/y0.\n\nStep 4) Solving the above for \u03c1 gives \u03c1 = \u03c10 * e^(-y/y0), which is the equation that describes how the density of air changes with height in our atmosphere.\n\nStep 5) For the second part, we are given that a zeppelin of volume 1500 m^3 is lifting a payload mass of 400 kg. The zeppelin is filled with helium, a lighter-than-air gas. As the zeppelin ascends, the volume remains constant but the density decreases. Based on the mass density relation, we find the density at which the zeppelin floats by putting the combined mass (payload + gas inside zeppelin) over the volume of the zeppelin.\n \nStep 6) Plugging in the formula for density as mass/volume, we get a density of 0.45 kg/m^3. Here, we account for the mass of the helium as well as the payload to get the overall mass.\n\nStep 7) We can then find the height at which this density is reached using the formula for density derived in the first part: \u03c1 = \u03c10 * e^(-y/y0). Solve this for y to find the height at which the zeppelin floats. \n\nStep 8) Plugging in the values for \u03c1, \u03c10, and y0 and solving for y gives us y \u2248 8000 meters, or 8 kilometers.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that the problem sets up a first-order differential equation relating the rate of decrease of air density \u03c1 to the height y.\n\nStep 2) Solve this differential equation to get an expression for \u03c1 as a function of y by separating variables and integrating.\n\nStep 3) For the second part of the problem, we find the density of the zeppelin by taking its overall mass (payload + helium mass) and dividing it by the volume.\n\nStep 4) Next, we solve the expression derived in step 2 for y to get the height.\n\nStep 5) Substitute appropriate values of \u03c1, \u03c10, and y0, to find y, which represents the height up to which the zeppelin will rise."
