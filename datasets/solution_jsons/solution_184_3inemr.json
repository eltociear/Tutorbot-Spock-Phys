    "Question": "20: What is the excess pressure inside a bubble of soap solution of radius 5.00 mm, given that the surface tension of soap solution at the temperature (20 \u00b0C) is 2.50 \u00d7 10^(\u20132^ N m^\u20131? If an air bubble of the same dimension were formed at a depth of 40.0 cm inside a container containing the soap solution (of relative density 1.20), what would be the pressure inside the bubble? (1 atmospheric pressure is 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa)",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nSurface tension of the soap solution, S = 2.50 \u00d7 10^(-2) N/m r = 5.00 mm = 5 \u00d7 10^(-3) m\r\nDensity of the soap solution, \u03c1 = 1.2 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3  Relative density of the soap solution = 1.20 \r\nAir bubble is at a depth, h = 30 cm = 0.3 m\r\nRadius of the air bubble, r = 4 mm = 5\u00d7 10^(-3) m\r\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m/s^2      1 atmospheric pressure = 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa We know;\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 4S } { r }\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left (\\frac{ 4 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{ -2 } }{ 5 \\times 10^{ -3 } } \\right )\\end{array} \\) = 20 Pa\r\nThus, the excess pressure inside the soap bubble is 20 Pa.Now, for the excess pressure inside the air bubble, P\u2019 = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 2S }{ r }\\end{array} \\)\r\nP\u2019 = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left (\\frac{ 2 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{ -2 } }{ 5 \\times 10^{ -3 } } \\right )\\end{array} \\) = 10 Pa\r\nThus, the excess pressure inside the air bubble is 10 Pa.\r\nAt a depth of 0.4 m, the total pressure inside the air bubble = Atmospheric pressure + h\u03c1g + P\u2019\r\n= 1.01 x 10^5 + 0.4 x 1.2 x 10^3 x 9.8 + 10= 1.06 x 10^5 Pa.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's identify the knowns that are given in the problem: the surface tension of the soap solution (S) is 2.50 x 10^-2 N/m, the radius of the bubble (r) is 5.00 mm or 5 x 10^-3 m, the relative density of the soap solution is 1.20 (which implies that the density, \u03c1, is 1.2 x 10^3 kg/m^3 as relative density is the ratio to the density of water), and an air bubble is at a depth, h, of 30 cm or 0.3 m., \n\nStep 2) We will also use established physics constants: the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s^2, and 1 atmospheric pressure is 1.01 x 10^5 Pa., \n\nStep 3) We will first solve for the excess pressure inside the soap bubble. For this, we use the equation for pressure inside a soap bubble, which is P = 4S/r, where S is the surface tension and r is the radius. This equation comes from the physics of surface tension where pressure inside a bubble is directly proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the radius of the bubble., \n\nStep 4) Now, we substitute our known values into the equation: P = 4*(2.5*10^-2)/(5*10^-3) which gives us P = 20 Pa. This is the excess pressure inside the soap bubble., \n\nStep 5) Next, we want to find the excess pressure inside the air bubble. The formula for this is different from the previous one and can be given as P' = 2S/r. Note that there are only 2S in the formula because an air bubble only has one surface, unlike a soap bubble., \n\nStep 6) Plugging our values into this equation gives us: P' = 2*(2.5*10^-2)/(5*10^-3), which results in P' = 10 Pa. This is the excess pressure inside the air bubble., \n\nStep 7) To find the total pressure inside the air bubble at a depth of h, we need to add the atmospheric pressure to the product of depth, density, gravity, and the air bubble's excess pressure, in this way: Pressure_total = Atmospheric pressure + h\u03c1g + P'. When doing this, we get Pressure_total = 1.01 x 10^5 + 0.4 x 1.2 x 10^3 x 9.8 + 10 = 1.06 x 10^5 Pa. So, the total pressure inside the bubble at that depth would be 1.06 x 10^5 Pa.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Note down all known quantities: surface tension, radius of the bubble, relative density of the solution, depth of the air bubble, acceleration due to gravity and atmospheric pressure., \n\nStep 2) Recall the pressure equation for a soap bubble: P = 4S/r, which helps you find the excess pressure inside the bubble based on its radius and surface tension., \n\nStep 3) Substitute values and find P = 20 Pa, the excess pressure inside the soap bubble., \n\nStep 4) Now, use the pressure equation for an air bubble (which differs from a soap bubble): P' = 2S/r., \n\nStep 5) Substitute known values into this formula to find P' = 10 Pa, the excess pressure inside the air bubble., \n\nStep 6) To find the total pressure inside the bubble at depth h, use the formula Pressure_total = Atmospheric pressure + h\u03c1g + P', involving the sum of atmospheric pressure, the product of depth, density and gravity, and the air bubble's excess pressure., \n\nStep 7) Substitute known values into the formula to obtain Pressure_total = 1.06 x 10^5 Pa, the total pressure inside the air bubble at the given depth."
