    "Question": "2.27. Estimate the average mass density of a sodium atom, assuming its size to be about 2.5 ? (Use the known values of Avogadro\u2019s number and the atomic mass of sodium). Compare it with the mass density of sodium in its crystalline phase: 970 kg m^\u20133. Are the two densities of the same order of magnitude? If so, why?\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "The diameter of sodium= 2.5 A = 2.5 x 10^(-10) m\r\nTherefore, the radius is 1.25 x 10^(-10) m\r\nThe volume of a sodium atom, V= (4/3)\u03c0r^3\r\n= (4/3) x (22/7) x (1.25 x 10^(-10))^ 3= 8.177 x 10^(-30) m^3\r\nMass of one mole atom of sodium = 23 g = 23 x 10^(-3) kg\r\n1 mole of sodium contains 6.023 x 10^23 atoms\r\nTherefore, the mass of one sodium atom, M= 23 x 10^(-3)/6.023 x 10^23= 3.818 x 10^(-26) kg\r\nThe atomic mass density of sodium, \u03c1= M/V\r\n=3.818 x 10^(-26)/8.177 x 10^(-30)\r\n= 0.46692 x 10^4= 4669.2 kg m^-3\r\nThe density of sodium in its solid state is 4669.2  kg m^-3, but in the crystalline phase, the density is 970 kg m^-3. Hence, both are in a different order. In the solid phase, atoms are tightly packed, but in the crystalline phase, atoms arrange a sequence which contains a void. So, the density in the solid phase is greater than in the crystalline phase.\r\n",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by converting the given size of the sodium atom, which is provided in Angstroms (\u00c5), into meters. This is because all our following calculations would require the units to be in the standard SI form. We know that 1 \u00c5 = 1 x 10^(-10) m, so the diameter of the sodium atom is calculated as 2.5 x 10^(-10) m.\n   \nStep 2) The next step involves finding the radius of the sodium atom. Since the radius is half the diameter, we calculate the radius as 1.25 x 10^(-10) m. \n\nStep 3) Using the radius, we can now find the volume of a single sodium atom. This can be done by using the formula for the volume of a sphere V= (4/3)\u03c0r^3, which gives us 8.177 x 10^(-30) m^3.\n\nStep 4) We move onto finding the mass of one sodium atom. We know that one mole of sodium weighs 23 g, which we convert into kg, getting 23 x 10^(-3) kg. Since one mole of sodium contains 6.023 x 10^23 atoms (Avogadro's number), the mass of a single sodium atom is calculated as 23 x 10^(-3)/6.023 x 10^23 which equal to 3.818 x 10^(-26) kg. \n\nStep 5) Now we have all the necessary information to calculate the mass density of a sodium atom. The formula for density is \u03c1= M/V. On substituting the obtained values we get \u03c1 as 0.46692 x 10^4 or 4669.2 kg m^-3.\n\nStep 6) Comparing this density with the given density of sodium in crystalline phase (970 kg m^-3), we see that the values do not share the same order of magnitude. The reason for this difference is due to the arrangement of atoms in the two phases. In the solid phase, atoms are more tightly packed than in the crystalline phase where atoms are arranged in a sequence with some amount of void or empty space.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert the size of the sodium atom from Angstroms into meters. \n   \nStep 2) Derive the radius of sodium atom from its diameter.\n\nStep 3) Calculate the volume of a sodium atom using the formula for the volume of a sphere. \n\nStep 4) Find the mass of a single sodium atom, leveraging the known mass of a mole of sodium and Avogadro's number.\n\nStep 5) Calculate the atom's mass density with the formula for density being mass/volume.\n\nStep 6) Compare the derived density with the given density of sodium in the crystalline phase and discuss why there is a difference in their magnitudes due to atom arrangement."
