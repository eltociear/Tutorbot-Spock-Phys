    "Question": "Q.14. In an experiment on the specific heat of a metal, a 0.20 kg block of the metal at 150 C is dropped in a copper calorimeter (of water equivalent 0.025 kg) containing 150 cm^3 of water at 27 C. The final temperature is 40 C. Compute the specific heat of the metal.

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides values for the mass of the metal block (m, 0.20 kg), initial temperature of the metal block (T1, 150\u00b0C), final temperature of the metal and the water that's heated (T2, 40\u00b0C), water equivalent of the calorimeter (m1, 0.025 kg), and the volume of water (V, 150 cm^3). All these values are converted into appropriate units for our equations. For example, the mass of the metal block is converted to grams for consistency with specific heat units, becoming 200 g. Step 2) The volume of water is used to compute its mass, M. Since water has a density of about 1 g/cm^3, the mass can be found by M=V x density = 150 x 1 = 150 g. Step 3) We now know the mass of the water heated, its initial temperature (27\u00b0C), and the final temperature (40\u00b0C). The change in temperature for the water and calorimeter system (\u0394T2) is calculated by subtracting the initial from the final temperature, \u0394T2=40-27=13\u00b0C. Step 4) Similarly, the change in the temperature for the metal block (\u0394T1) is found by subtracting the final temperature from the initial, \u0394T1=T1-T2=150-40=110\u00b0C. Step 5) The law of conservation of energy is applied in the form of the equation mH\u0394T1 = (M+m1)Cw\u0394T2, which states that the heat lost by the metal is equal to the heat gained by both the water and calorimeter. Here, H represents the specific heat of the metal (which we're trying to find), and Cw represents the specific heat of water (a known constant, 4.186 J/g\u00b0C). Step 6) This equation is then rearranged to solve for H, the specific heat of the metal. H = [(M+m1)Cw\u0394T2]/m\u0394T1 is the resultant equation. Step 7) Known values are inserted into this equation now. H = [(150 +25) x 4.186 x 13]/(200 x 110) = 0.43 J/g\u00b0C, which is the specific heat of the metal. Step 8) Lastly, the effect of heat loss to the environment is considered. Since any heat lost to the environment reduces the observed change in the water's temperature, and thus reduces the computed value for the metal's specific heat, we can conclude that the answer would be smaller than the actual specific heat of the metal if heat losses are relevant.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert all known values into suitable units. Step 2) Use the volume of water and its density to calculate the mass of the water. Step 3) Calculate the change in temperature for the water and calorimeter system (\u0394T2). Step 4) Calculate the change in the metal temperature (\u0394T1). Step 5) Use the principle of conservation of energy to set up an equation expressing the fact that the heat lost by the metal equals the heat gained by the water and the calorimeter. Step 6) Rearrange this equation to solve for H, the specific heat of the metal. Step 7) Input all known values into the equation to solve for H. Step 8) Discuss the effect of heat loss to the surroundings on the final value of H."
