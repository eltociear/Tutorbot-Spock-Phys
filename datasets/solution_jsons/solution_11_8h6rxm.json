    "Question": "2.13 A physical quantity P is related to four observables a, b, c and d as follows:P = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{a^{3}b^{2}}{\\sqrt{c}d}\\end{array} \\)\r\nThe percentage errors of measurement in a, b, c and d are 1%, 3%, 4% and 2%, respectively. What is the percentage error in the quantity P? If the value of P calculated using the above relation turns out to be 3.763, to what value should you round off the result?",
    "Original Solution": "( \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\end{array} \\) x 100 ) % = ( 3 x \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\end{array} \\) x 100 + 2 x \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\Delta b}{b}\\end{array} \\) x 100 + \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{2}\\end{array} \\) \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\Delta c}{c}\\end{array} \\) x 100 + \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\Delta d}{d}\\end{array} \\) x 100 ) %\r\n= 3 x 1 + 2 x 3 + \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{1}{2}\\end{array} \\) x 4 + 2\r\n= 3 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 13 %\r\nP = 4.235\r\n=  \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{13P}{100}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{13\\times 4.235}{100}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= 0.55\r\nThe error lies in the first decimal point, so the value of p = 4.3",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) To begin, recognise that the question provides the percentage errors for measurements a, b, c, and d, respectively as 1%, 3%, 4%, and 2%. It asks to determine the overall percentage error in the quantity P. Given the formula of P, the percentage error in P can be derived from the rules to calculate errors in physical quantities, where the powers in the formula of the quantity become coefficients in the formula for its error. Step 2) Based on this, the formula for the percentage error in P is given by: ( \u0394P/P x 100 )% = (3 x \u0394a/a x 100 + 2 x \u0394b/b x 100 + 1/2 x \u0394c/c x 100 + \u0394d/d x 100 )%. Step 3) In this formula, each percentage error is multiplied by a coefficient derived from the power to that variable in the formula for P, and those terms are summed up to give the overall percentage error in P. Step 4) Substitute the given percentage errors in this formula, so that the calculation is as follows: 3 x 1 + 2 x 3 + 1/2 x 4 + 2, which simplifies to: 3 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 13. Therefore, the total percentage error in P is 13%. Step 5) Now, the question also states that P is calculated to be 3.763. Apply the total percentage error to this value to find the absolute error in it: The absolute error in P = 13P/100 = 13 x 3.763 / 100 = 0.489. Step 6) The answer should be rounded to the nearest place that corresponds with the absolute error. Since the error lies in the first decimal place, you should round the value of P to 3.8.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the provided percentage errors for a, b, c, and d, plus the formula for P. Step 2) Extract from this the formula for the percentage error in P: ( \u0394P/P x 100 )% = (3 x \u0394a/a x 100 + 2 x \u0394b/b x 100 + 1/2 x \u0394c/c x 100 + \u0394d/d x 100 )%. Step 3) Substitute the given percentage errors into that formula to find a total percentage error of 13% for P. Step 4) Apply this total percentage error to the calculated value of P to find the absolute error in it, which yields 0.55. Step 5) Conclude that the value of P should be rounded off to 3.8, as the error lies in the first decimal place."
