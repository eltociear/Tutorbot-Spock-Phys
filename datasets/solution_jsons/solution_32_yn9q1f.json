    "Question": "Q10.

(Take g = 9.8 m s^\u20132 and neglect air resistance).\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "(a) The acceleration due to gravity always acts downwards towards the centre of the Earth.\r\n(b) At the highest point of its motion, the velocity of the ball will be zero, but the acceleration due to gravity will be 9.8 m s^\u20132  acting vertically downward.\r\n(c) If we consider the highest point of ball motion as x = 0, t = 0, and vertically downward direction to be +ve direction of the x-axis, then\r\n(i) During the upward motion of the ball before reaching the highest point position, x = +ve, velocity, v = -ve and acceleration, a = +ve.\r\n(ii) During the downward motion of the ball after reaching the highest point position, velocity and acceleration, all three quantities are positive.\r\n(d) Initial speed of the ball, u= -29.4 m/s\r\nThe final velocity of the ball, v = 0\r\nAcceleration = 9.8 m/s^2\r\nApplying in the equation v^2 \u2013 u^2 = 2gs\r\n0 \u2013 (-29.4)2 = 2 (9.8) s\r\ns = \u2013 864.36/19.6 = \u2013 44.1\r\nHeight to which the ball rises = \u2013 44.1 m (negative sign represents upward direction)\r\nConsidering the equation of motion\r\nv = u + at\r\n0 = (-29.4) + 9.8t\r\nt = 29.4/9.8 = 3 seconds\r\nTherefore, the total time taken for the ball to return to the player\u2019s hands is 3 +3 = 6 s.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem first asks about the direction of acceleration during the upward motion of the ball. The acceleration due to gravity always acts downward towards the centre of the Earth. Even when an object is moving upwards, the acceleration due to gravity still acts downwards. This is because gravity is a force exerted by the Earth that pulls objects towards its centre. Step 2) The question then asks about the velocity and acceleration of the ball at the highest point of motion. At its highest point, an object thrown upwards will have a velocity of zero. This is because it momentarily stops moving upwards before it starts its descent. However, despite the zero velocity, acceleration due to gravity still applies. Thus, the acceleration is 9.8 m/s^2 acting downwards. Step 3) For part c, we need to assign signs to position, velocity, and acceleration considering certain conditions. If we consider the point at maximum height as our origin (x = 0, t = 0) and consider vertically downward as the positive direction of the x-axis, we can determine the signs. During upward motion before reaching the highest point, position is positive (above the origin), velocity is negative (moving contrary to our predefined positive direction) and acceleration is positive (always acting downward). During the downward motion after reaching the highest point, position, velocity and acceleration can all three be considered positive as they act in the downward direction. Step 4) Finally, we are asked to calculate the peak height and the total time of flight. The initial speed (u) is considered negative under our chosen conditions because the ball is thrown upwards, contrary to our defined positive direction. The final velocity (v) at the highest point is zero as the throw reverses direction there. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is given and positive, acting downwards. Using the second equation of motion (v^2 = u^2 + 2gs), we can solve for the height (s). Subtracting u^2 from both sides and solving for s gives a height of -44.1 m. The negative sign simply represents the upward direction. For the time, we use the first equation of motion (v = u + gt) and solve for t to get time = 3 seconds. This is the time for the ball to rise and fall back to the ground. So the total round-trip time is 2*3 = 6 seconds.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that the acceleration due to gravity always acts downward, even when the object is moving in the opposite direction. This is because gravity is a constant force drawing objects towards the center of the Earth. Step 2) Understand that at its highest point, even though an object's velocity is zero, acceleration still exists due to gravity. Step 3) Establish a frame of reference\u2014choose the highest point to be the origin, consider the upward direction to be negative and downwards as positive. This influences the sign of your position, velocity and acceleration at different points of the motion. Upward motion before reaching the top gives +ve position, -ve velocity and +ve acceleration. When the ball starts descending, all three quantities are positive. Step 4) Use two equations of motion to find the maximum height (s) and the total time of flight (t). The second equation of motion is used to find the height reached by the ball, given initial velocity(u), final velocity(v) and acceleration(g). The time is found using the first equation of motion and then doubled because the time of ascent and descent are the same when there is no air resistance."
