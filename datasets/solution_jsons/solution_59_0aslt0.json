    "Question": "Q27: As a vector is having both direction and magnitude, then is it necessary that if anything is having direction and magnitude, it is termed as a vector? The rotation of an object is defined by the angle of rotation about the axis and the direction of rotation of the axis. Will it be a rotation of a vector? ",
    "Original Solution": "No and no\r\nA physical quantity which is having both direction and magnitude is not necessarily a vector. For instance, in spite of having direction and magnitude, the current is a scalar quantity. The basic necessity for a physical quantity to fall in a vector category is that it ought to follow the \u201claw of vector addition\u201d.\r\nAs the rotation of a body about an axis does not follow the basic necessity to be a vector, i.e., it does not follow the \u201claw of vector addition\u201d, so it is not a vector quantity. Although in some cases, rotation of a body about an axis by a small angle follows the law of vector addition, so it is termed a vector.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin by recognizing that vectors are quantities which have both direction and magnitude. However, while these are the characteristics of a vector, they are not the only prerequisites for a quantity to be considered a vector. Step 2) Understand that a physical quantity to be deemed as a vector, it is crucial that it follows the 'law of vector addition'. There may be objects like electric current that have both direction and magnitude but are still not vectors because they do not obey this law. Step 3) When addressing the second part of the question about the rotation of objects, note that the way in which rotation is defined \u2013 i.e., the rotation angle around the axis and the direction of the rotation axis \u2013 gives it properties similar to a vector. But, it's important to remember that the determining factor for a quantity to be a vector is whether it follows the 'law of vector addition', not whether it has a direction and magnitude. Step 4) Take into consideration that, while the rotation does have both direction and magnitude, it does not follow the 'law of vector addition' and is hence not termed a vector. Note however, that in some specific cases where the rotation of a body about an axis by a small angle follows the law of vector addition, it can be termed as a vector.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Establish understanding that vectors are quantities that have both direction and magnitude. However, note that these characteristics are not the sole requirements for a quantity to be a vector. Step 2) Learn that for a physical quantity to be considered a vector, it must follow the 'law of vector addition'. Step 3) When considering rotation, which involves direction and magnitude but does not always follow the 'law of vector addition', it is not always classified as a vector. Step 4) Understand that there are some specific cases where rotation fulfills the condition of following the 'law of vector addition' and thus, can be considered a vector."
