    "Question": "Q3: From the following, identify the vector quantities:\r\nPressure, temperature, energy, time, gravitational potential, power, total path length, charge, coefficient of friction, impulse.",
    "Original Solution": "Impulse is the product of force and time. Since force is a vector quantity, its product with time which is a scalar quantity, gives a vector quantity.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is asking us to identify the vector quantities out of the given list: Pressure, temperature, energy, time, gravitational potential, power, total path length, charge, coefficient of friction, impulse. A vector quantity is one that is characterized by both magnitude (how much) and direction (which way). Examples include velocity, force, and momentum. These are contrasted with scalar quantities, which only have magnitude and no direction, like temperature, time, and energy. Step 2) It is important here to understand that the product of a vector quantity and a scalar quantity results in a vector quantity. This is because the scalar quantity can change the magnitude of the vector, but not its direction. Step 3) Given these fundamentals, when we look at the list, impulse sticks out. This is because impulse is equal to the product of a force (a vector quantity) and time (a scalar quantity). Hence, impulse is indeed a vector quantity since it is characterized by both a magnitude (the product of force and time) and a direction (the same as the force). Step 4) There is no other quantity on the list that fits this criteria, so impulse is the only vector quantity from the provided list.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Start by understanding that the problem is asking you to identify the vector quantities from a given list. Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction. Step 2) Remember that the product of a vector with a scalar is still a vector, as the scalar can only change the magnitude, not the direction. Step 3) Using this knowledge, realize that impulse is a vector, as it is the product of force (a vector) and time (a scalar). Therefore, it has both magnitude and direction. Step 4) After scanning through the list again, confirm that impulse is the only vector quantity in the list. The remaining items listed are scalar quantities as they only define magnitude without direction."
