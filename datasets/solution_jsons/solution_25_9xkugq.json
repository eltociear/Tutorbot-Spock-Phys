    "Question": "2.31. The farthest objects in our Universe discovered by modern astronomers are so distant that light emitted by them takes billions of years to reach the Earth. These objects (known as quasars) have many puzzling features which have not yet been satisfactorily explained. What is the distance in km of a quasar from which light takes 3.0 billion years to reach us?\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "Time taken by light from the quasar to reach the observer, t = 3.0 billion years = 3.0 x 10^9 years = 3.0 x 10^9 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 s\r\n= 94608000 x 10^9  s\r\n=  9.46 x 10^16 m\r\nSpeed of light = 3 x 10^8 m/s\r\nDistance of quasar from Earth  = 3.0 x 10^8 x 9.46 x 10^16 m\r\n= 28.38 x 10^24 m",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step in solving this problem is by recognizing what we are given, which is the time light takes to travel from the quasar to the Earth. This value is given as 3.0 billion years. 'Billion' is the same as 10^9 so the time can be rewritten as 3.0 x 10^9 years. Step 2) However, to use this time correctly in the equation for speed, we need the time to be in seconds. When we convert 3.0 x 10^9 years to seconds, we multiply by the number of seconds in a year. There are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so the conversion results in 3.0 x 10^9 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 seconds. The result reduces to 9.46 x 10^16 seconds. Step 3) The next step requires using the speed of light, which is universally accepted to be 3 x 10^8 meters per second. Step 4) The distance light travels is found by multiplying the speed of light by the time it travels. In this case, we have 3.0 x 10^8 x 9.46 x 10^16 meters. The result simplifies to a distance of 28.38 x 10^24 meters from Earth.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin by acknowledging the given time it takes from light emitted by the quasar to reach us. This time is given in years, specifically 3.0 billion years which is equal to 3.0 x 10^9 years. Step 2) Convert this time from years to seconds by multiplying by the number of seconds in a year. This results in 9.46 x 10^16 seconds. Step 3) Recognize the constant speed of light, which is 3 x 10^8 meters per second. Step 4) Multiply the time it takes for light to reach us with the speed of light to find the distance a quasar is from Earth. The final distance is 28.38 x 10^24 meters."
