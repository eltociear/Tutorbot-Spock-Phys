    "Original Solution": "(a) sin\u03c9t\u2212cos\u03c9t\r\n=\u221a2 [(1/\u221a2) sin\u03c9t\u2212 (1/\u221a2) cos\u03c9t]\r\n= \u221a2 [sin\u03c9t\u00d7cos (\u03c0/4) \u2212cos\u03c9t\u00d7sin (\u03c0/4)]\r\n= \u221a2 [sin\u03c9t \u2013 (\u03c0/4)]\r\nIt is a simple harmonic motion and its period is 2\u03c0/4\u200b\r\n(b) sin^3(\u03c9t)=1/4[3sin \u03c9t\u2212sin 3\u03c9t]\r\nHere sin \u03c9t and sin 3\u03c9t individually represent SHM.

Therefore, it is a non-periodic motion.\r\n(f) The given function 1+\u03c9t+\u03c9^2 t^2\r\nIt is non-periodic.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is asking us to classify several functions of time into three categories: simple harmonic motion, which is a type of periodic motion characterized by a sinusoidal waveform; periodic but non-simple harmonic motion, which repeats over time but not in a sinusoidal fashion; and non-periodic motion, which doesn't repeat over time. Step 2) For function (a), we first express sin\u03c9t - cos\u03c9t as \u221a2 [(1/\u221a2) sin\u03c9t- (1/\u221a2) cos\u03c9t]. This is essentially converting the sum of sin and cos into a single sine function by applying the formula sin(a+b) = sin(a)cos(b) - cos(a)sin(b). As a result, we have \u221a2 [sin\u03c9t \u2013 (\u03c0/4)]. Since this is a sine function, it represents a simple harmonic motion with a period of 2\u03c0/\u03c9. Step 3) Function (b) is sin^3(\u03c9t)=1/4[3sin \u03c9t\u2212sin 3\u03c9t]. This function can be broken down into two sinusoidal components: sin \u03c9t and sin 3\u03c9t. Even though each component individually represents simple harmonic motion, their superposition is periodic but not simple harmonic. The overall period here is 2\u03c0/\u03c9. Step 4) Function (c) is 3cos[\u03c0/4 -2\u03c9t] which can be rewritten as 3cos[2\u03c9t - \u03c0/4] by applying trigonometric identities. Like in step 2 and 3, it can be identified as a cosine function and hence it is a simple harmonic motion with a period of \u03c0/\u03c9. Step 5) Function (d) can be broken down into three simple harmonic motions with periods of 2\u03c0/\u03c9, 2\u03c0/3\u03c9, and 2\u03c0/5\u03c9 respectively. The superposition of these three components is periodic but not simple harmonic. Step 6) Function (e) is exp(-\u03c9^2 t^2). This is an exponential function that doesn't repeat over time, so it's considered non-periodic motion. Step 7) Function (f) is 1+\u03c9t+\u03c9^2 t^2 it is non-periodic as it doesn't exhibit any repetitive pattern over a specified interval.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that we need to classify the provided functions into one of the three categories: simple harmonic motion, periodic but non-simple harmonic motion, and non-periodic motion. Step 2) For function (a), rewrite it in terms of sine of a phase difference. Determine it to be simple harmonic motion with the given period. Step 3) Observe that function (b) can be considered as a combination of two sinusoidal functions. Determine it to be periodic but not simple harmonic, and provide the common period. Step 4) Redefine function (c) using trigonometric properties. Identify it as simple harmonic motion and determine the period. Step 5) Understand that function (d) is a combination of several sinusoidal functions. Pick the common period, and categorize this function as periodic but not simple harmonic. Step 6) Identify function (e) as a non-repetitive exponential function, hence classify it as non-periodic motion. Step 7) Recognize that function (f) doesn't exhibit any repeating pattern, hence it is a non-periodic motion."
