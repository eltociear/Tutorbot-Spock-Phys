    "Question": "4. A cylinder with a movable piston contains 3 moles of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure. The walls of the cylinder are made of a heat insulator, and the piston is insulated by having a pile of sand on it. By what factor does the pressure of the gas increase if the gas is compressed to half its original volume?",
    "Original Solution": "The cylinder is completely insulated from its surroundings.\r\nTherefore, no heat is exchanged between the system (cylinder) and its surroundings.\r\nThus, the process is adiabatic\r\nInitial pressure inside the cylinder = P1\r\nFinal pressure inside the cylinder = P2\r\nInitial volume inside the cylinder = V1\r\nFinal volume inside the cylinder = V2\r\nRatio of specific heat, \u03b3 = Cp / Cv = 1.4\r\nFor an adiabatic process, we have:\r\nP1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3\r\nThe final volume is compressed to half of its initial volume\r\nHence,\r\nV2 = V1 / 2\r\nP1V1\u03b3 = P2(V1 / 2)\u03b3\r\nP2 / P1 = V1\u03b3 / (V1 / 2)\u03b3\r\n= 21.4\r\nWe get,\r\n= 2.639\r\nTherefore, the pressure increases by a factor of 2.639",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Observe the situation. We are given a cylinder completely insulated from its surroundings and containing hydrogen gas. The insulation indicates that no heat is exchanged between the system aka the cylinder, and the environment. This characterizes an adiabatic process. Step 2) List all the important parameters. At the start of the process, our initial pressure inside the cylinder = P1 and the initial volume = V1. As a result of compression, the final pressure = P2 and the final volume = V2. We also need the ratio of specific heat, \u03b3, which is Cp / Cv, and equals 1.4 for hydrogen. Step 3) Recall the suitable formula for an adiabatic process, which is P1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3. This equation relates the initial and final pressure and volume of an adiabatic process. Step 4) Here, we are compressing the gas to half its original volume, therefore, V2 = V1 / 2. Step 5) Next, insert this value into the above equation. Hence, we get P1V1\u03b3 = P2(V1 / 2)\u03b3. Step 6) Rearrange this equation to find P2 / P1, which represents the factor by which the pressure increases. Carry out the division and the exponentiation to get P2 / P1 = 21.4, or equivalently, P2 / P1 = 2.639 to three decimal places. Step 7) Interpret the result. With the calculated value, we conclude that the pressure increases by a factor of 2.639 due to the gas being compressed to half its original volume.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the scenario as an adiabatic process - that is, no heat is exchanged between the system and surroundings because of insulation. Step 2) Identify all the essential parameters: initial pressure (P1), final pressure (P2), initial volume (V1), final volume (V2), and the ratio of specific heat, \u03b3. Step 3) Use the adiabatic process formula, which relates initial and final pressures and volumes: P1V1\u03b3 = P2V2\u03b3. Step 4) Given that the gas volume is compressed to half of its initial volume, V2 = V1 / 2. Step 5) Substitute V2 in the equation from Step 3, yielding P1V1\u03b3 = P2(V1 / 2)\u03b3. Step 6) Simplify the equation to find the ratio of P2 to P1; this ratio indicates the factor of pressure increase. Step 7) Finally, interpret the result which shows that due to the compression of gas to half its volume, the pressure increases by a factor of 2.639."
