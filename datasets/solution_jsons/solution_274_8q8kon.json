    "Question": "Q27. A bat is flitting about in a cave, navigating via ultrasonic beeps. Assume that the sound emission frequency of the bat is 40 kHz. During one fast swoop directly toward a flat wall surface, the bat is moving at 0.03 times the speed of sound in the air. What frequency does the bat hear reflected off the wall?",
    "Original Solution": "The sound emission frequency of the bat = 40 kHz\r\nThe velocity of the bat, vb = 0.03 v\r\nWhere v is the velocity of the sound in the air\r\nThe apparent frequency of the sound hitting the wall\r\n= 40/0.97 kHz\r\nThe frequency gets reflected by the wall and is received by the bat moving towards the wall\r\n= (1.03 x 40 /0.97) = 42.47 kHz.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We know that the sound emission frequency of the bat is 40 kHz. This is the frequency at which the bat is able to emit sounds. Step 2) Also, we know that the velocity of the bat is 0.03 times the speed of sound in the air, denoted as vb = 0.03v. The 'v' here denotes the velocity of sound in air. This is to emphasize that the bat's speed is equivalent to a fraction of the general speed of sound. Step 3) Now, consider the bat is emitting sound while moving towards the wall. The moving bat causes a Doppler shift in the frequency heard by the wall. This can be calculated by the formula 40 kHz / 0.97, which gives the apparent frequency of the sound when it hits the wall. Step 4) The sound wave that hits the wall is then reflected back towards the bat. Given that the bat is moving towards the wall, this reflected sound wave is again Doppler shifted. To find the frequency that the bat hears, we multiply the previous frequency (40/0.97 kHz) by a factor of 1.03, getting approximately 42.47 kHz. This is the frequency of the sound the bat hears reflected off the wall.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We start with the given bat's emission frequency of 40 kHz and the fact that the bat's speed is 0.03 times the speed of sound in air. Step 2) The sound emitted by the bat hits the wall with a Doppler-shifted frequency, which we calculate using the formula 40 kHz / 0.97. Step 3) When this sound wave is reflected off the wall and reaches the bat, it undergoes another Doppler shift due to the bat's motion towards the wall. Step 4) We compute the final frequency the bat hears as (1.03 x 40 / 0.97) kHz, which is approximately 42.47 kHz. This makes use of the principle of the Doppler Effect, modeling how observed frequencies change when the source or the observer are moving."
