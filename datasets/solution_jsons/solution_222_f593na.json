    "Question": "1. Estimate the fraction of molecular volume to the actual volume occupied by oxygen gas at STP. Take the diameter of an oxygen molecule to be 3 \u00c5.",
    "Original Solution": "Diameter of an oxygen molecule, d = 3 \u00c5\r\nRadius, r = d / 2\r\nr = 3 / 2 = 1.5 \u00c5 = 1.5 x 10^-8 cm\r\nThe actual volume occupied by 1 mole of oxygen gas at STP = 22400 cm^3\r\nThe molecular volume of oxygen gas, V = 4 / 3 \u03c0r^3. N\r\nWhere, N is Avogadro\u2019s number = 6.023 x 10^23 molecules/ mole\r\nHence,\r\nV = 4 / 3 x 3.14 x (1.5 x 10^-8)^3 x 6.023 x 10^23\r\nWe get,\r\nV = 8.51 cm^3\r\nTherefore, the ratio of the molecular volume to the actual volume of oxygen = 8.51/ 22400 = 3. 8 x 10^-4",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides us with the diameter of an oxygen molecule, which is said to be 3 \u00c5. In the solution, we convert this to a radius, as it's more convenient for further computations. This is done by dividing the diameter by 2, which gives us a radius of 1.5 \u00c5. Step 2) Because we need the radius in centimeters for the calculations later, we convert the radius from Angstroms to centimeters. Since 1 \u00c5 equals 1 x 10^-8 cm, we get 1.5 x 10^-8 cm. Step 3) We are given that the actual volume occupied by 1 mole of oxygen gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is 22400 cm^3. This is a standard fact and can be taken as a constant. Step 4) We use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is V = 4 / 3 \u03c0r^3 where r is the radius of the sphere, to determine the volume of a single molecule of oxygen. Here, however, the volume calculated needs to be for a mole of molecules. So, we multiply this volume by Avogadro\u2019s number (N), which is approximately 6.023 x10^23 molecules/mole. This converts the volume of a single molecule into the volume of a mole of molecules. Step 5) We insert the values of \u03c0, r, and N into the formula, and calculate the volume, which comes out to be about 8.51 cm^3. Here, we are performing a basic mathematical computation. Step 6) Finally, we calculate the ratio of the molecular volume of the oxygen gas to the actual volume. This ratio is obtained by dividing the molecular volume by the actual volume. We find that the fraction is approximately equal to 3.8 x 10^-4.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) First, we find the radius of an oxygen molecule by dividing the given diameter by 2 and convert it into centimeters. Step 2) Next, we recall the standard volume that 1 mole of any gas occupies at STP, which is 22400 cm^3. Step 3) We then calculate the volume of one mole of oxygen molecules using the formula for the volume of a sphere. This is achieved by multiplying the volume of a single molecule by Avogadro's number because we are interested in an entire mole of molecules. Step 4) After inserting the values of \u03c0, r, and Avogadro\u2019s number into the formula, we perform the computation to find the volume. Step 5) Finally, we calculate the ratio of the molecular volume to the actual volume by dividing the two volumes. This gives the fraction of the molecular volume to the actual volume that oxygen gas occupies at STP."
