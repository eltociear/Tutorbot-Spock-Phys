    "Question": "2.23 The Sun is a hot plasma (ionised matter) with its inner core at a temperature exceeding 107 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high temperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you expect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and liquids or gases? Check if your guess is correct from the following data: a mass of the Sun = 2.0 \u00d7 10^30 kg, the radius of the Sun = 7.0 \u00d7 10^8 m.",
    "Original Solution": "Mass = 2 x 10^30 kg\r\nRadius = 7 x 10^8 m\r\nVolume V = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\end{array} \\)\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{4}{3}\\end{array} \\) x \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{22}{7}\\end{array} \\) x (7 x 10^8)^3\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{88}{21}\\end{array} \\) x 512 x 10^24 m^3 = 2145.52 x 10^24 m^3\r\nDensity = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{Mass}{Volume}\\end{array} \\) = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{3\\times 10^{30}}{2145.52\\times 10^{24}}\\end{array} \\) = 1.39 x 10^3 kg/m5.\r\nThe density is in the range of solids and liquids. Its density is due to the high gravitational attraction on the outer layer by the inner layer of the sun.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Start by noting the values given: the mass of the sun (M) is equal to 2 x 10^30 kg and the radius of the sun (r) equals to 7 x 10^8 m. These are important parameters for finding the density of the sun. Step 2) Use these parameters to compute the volume of the sun (V) with the formula V = 4/3 * \u03c0 * r^3 which is the formula for volume of a sphere, considering the sun is a near-perfect sphere. Step 3) Substitute the given values into the volume formula: V = 4/3 * \u03c0 * (7 x 10^8 m)^3 and simplify the calculation to get an approximate value V = 2145.52 x 10^24 m^3. This is the estimated volume of the sun. Step 4) Use the volume and mass of the sun to calculate the density (d) using the formula d = M/V. Substitute the given values for the Sun's mass and calculated volume into the formula to find the density of the sun: d = 2 x 10^30 kg / 2145.52 x 10^24 m^3 = 1.39 x 10^3 kg/m^3. This value represents the average density of the Sun. Step 5) Compare the calculated density of the sun to the typical ranges of densities for solids, liquids, and gases. Given its plasma state, you would initially expect the sun to have a gas-like density; however, due to its extremely high gravitational pull, the sun's average density actually falls in the range typical of solids and liquids.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Note the given values: the mass (M) and radius (r) of the sun.

Step 3) Substitute the sun's radius into the volume formula to get an estimated volume of the sun. Step 4) Plug the given mass and the calculated volume into the formula for density: d = M/V to get the average density of the sun. Step 5) Compare the sun's density to the typical ranges of densities for solids, liquids, and gases. It turns out the sun's density is similar to that of solids and liquids due to its high gravitational pull."
