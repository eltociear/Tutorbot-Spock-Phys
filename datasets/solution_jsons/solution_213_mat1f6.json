    "Question": "1. A geyser heats water flowing at the rate of 3.0 litres per minute from 27 C to 77 C. If the geyser operates on a gas burner, what is the rate of consumption of the fuel if its heat of combustion is 4.0 \u00d7 10^4 J/g?",
    "Original Solution": "Given\r\nWater is flowing at a rate of 3.0 litre/min\r\nThe geyser heats the water, raising the temperature from 270 C to 770 C.\r\nInitial temperature, T1 = 270 C\r\nFinal temperature, T2 = 770 C\r\nRise in temperature, T = T2 \u2013 T1\r\n= 77 \u2013 27\r\n= 500 C\r\nHeat of combustion = 4 x 10^4 J / g\r\nSpecific heat of water, C = 4.2 J / g C\r\nMass of flowing water, m = 3.0 litre / min\r\n= 3000 g / min\r\nTotal heat used, Q = mcT\r\n= 3000 x 4.2 x 50\r\nOn calculation, we get,\r\n= 6.3 x 10^5 J / min\r\nRate of consumption = 6.3 x 10^5 / (4 x 10^4)\r\nWe get,\r\n= 15.75 g/min\r\nTherefore, rate of consumption is 15.75 g/min",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, we identify all the known quantities in the problem: water is flowing at 3 litres per minute, the geyser is heating the water from an initial temperature, T1, of 27 degrees Celsius to a final temperature, T2, of 77 degrees Celsius, and the heat of combustion provided by the fuel is 4 x 10^4 joules per gram. \n\n Step 2) We then calculate the change in temperature, T. To do this, we subtract T1 from T2, which gives us T = 77 - 27 = 50 degrees Celsius. It gives the amount of temperature rise due to the operation of the geyser. \n\n Step 3) We also note that the specific heat of water, C, which is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius, is going to be 4.2 joules per gram degree Celsius. This is a constant and well-known value in Physics. \n\n Step 4) Furthermore, we recognize that the flow rate of water given is in litres per minute; however, to be usable in our equation, we need it in grams. We do this conversion knowing that 1 litre of water is equivalent to 1000 grams. Hence, the flow rate of water is 3000 grams per minute.\n\n Step 5) Afterwards, we use the formula for total heat used, represented by the symbol Q, which is mcT, where m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat of water, and T is the rise in temperature. Plugging our values into the equation, we get Q = 3000 x 4.2 x 50 = 6.3 x 10^5 joules per minute.\n\n Step 6) Finally, we calculate the rate of consumption of the fuel. To do this, we divide the total heat used by the heat of combustion of the fuel. That is 6.3 x 10^5 / (4 x 10^4) = 15.75 grams per minute. Thus, the rate of consumption of the fuel by the geyser is 15.75 grams per minute.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Take note of the known values given in the problem: the flow rate of the water, the starting and final temperatures, and the heat of combustion for the fuel. \n\n Step 2) Calculate the change in temperature (T) by subtracting the initial temperature from the final temperature. \n\n Step 3) Acknowledge the specific heat capacity of water (C) which is a standard value, required to compute the total heat used by the geyser. \n\n Step 4) Convert the water flow rate from litres to grams, as the equations to be used need the mass in grams. \n\n Step 5) Use the heat equation (Q = mcT) to calculate the total amount of heat used by the geyser to heat the water.\n\n Step 6) Lastly, find the rate of fuel consumption by dividing the total heat used by the heat generated by combustion of the fuel per gram. The result is the fuel consumption in gram per minute."
