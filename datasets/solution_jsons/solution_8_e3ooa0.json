    "Question": "2.10 State the number of significant figures in the following:(a) 0.007 m^2(b) 2.64 \u00d7 10^24 kg(c) 0.2370 g cm^\u20133(d) 6.320 J(e) 6.032 N m^\u20132(f) 0.0006032 m^2",
    "Original Solution": "(a) 0.007 m2\r\nThe given value is 0.007 m2.\r\nOnly one significant digit. It is 7.\r\n(b) 2.64 \u00d7 10^24 kg\r\nThe value is 2.64 \u00d7 10^24 kg\r\nFor the determination of significant values, the power of 10 is irrelevant. The digits 2, 6, and 4 are significant figures. The number of significant digits is 3.\r\n(c) 0.2370 g cm^\u20133\r\nThe value is 0.2370 g cm\u20133\r\nFor the given value with decimals, all the numbers 2, 3, 7, and 0 are significant. The 0 before the decimal point is not significant\r\n(d) All the numbers are significant. The number of significant figures here is 4.\r\n(e) 6, 0, 3, and 2 are significant figures. Therefore, the number of significant figures is 4.\r\n(f) 6, 0, 3, and 2 are significant figures. The number of significant figures is 4.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understand that significant figures are all the numbers that are certain in a measurement, plus one last number that is uncertain or approximated. In other words, they include all the reliably known digits in a number plus the first uncertain digit.\n\nStep 2) For (a) 0.007 m^2, ignore the leading zeros as they are not significant. They are only placeholders to indicate the decimal point location and do not affect the measurement precision. They are there to show that the magnitude of the size is less than 1. So, the only significant digit we have here is 7. Thus, the number of significant figures in 0.007 m^2 is 1.\n\nStep 3) For (b) 2.64 \u00d7 10^24 kg, recognize that in scientific notation, all the digits in the mantissa (the part before the exponent) are significant. The exponent part just shows the size of the number and doesn't affect its precision. So, there are three significant figures in this measurement: 2, 6, and 4.\n\nStep 4) Considering (c) 0.2370 g cm^-3, note that trailing zeros after the decimal point are considered significant because they provide information about the measurement's precision. Thus, all the numbers including the trailing zero (2, 3, 7, and 0) are significant. The number of significant figures in this number is 4.\n\nStep 5) For (d) 6.320 J, see that all the numbers here are significant, including the trailing zero after the decimal point. Therefore, the number of significant figures in 6.320 J is 4.\n\nStep 6) With regard to (e) 6.032 N m^-2, observe that all the numbers are significant, in this situation. There are no leading or trailing zeros before or after the decimal point. Thus, the number of significant figures is 4.\n\nStep 7) For (f) 0.0006032 m^2, disregard the leading zeros as placeholders. The rest of the numbers (6, 0, 3, and 2) are significant, giving us four significant figures.\n",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recall the concept of significant figures, which includes all the certain digits plus the first uncertain digit in a measurement.\n\nStep 2) For (a) 0.007 m^2, exclude leading zeros to find 1 significant digit: 7.\n\nStep 3) For (b) 2.64 \u00d7 10^24 kg, consider the whole mantissa (2, 6, and 4) as significant, ignoring the power, resulting in 3 significant figures.\n\nStep 4) For (c) 0.2370 g cm^-3, count all digits including the trailing zero as significant figures, so there are 4 significant figures.\n\nStep 5) For (d) 6.320 J, and (e) 6.032 N m^-2, consider all the digits, including the trailing zeros, as significant figures, resulting in 4 significant figures each.\n\nStep 6) For (f) 0.0006032 m^2, ignore the leading zeros and count the rest of the digits resulting in 4 significant figures."
