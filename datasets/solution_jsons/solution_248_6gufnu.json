    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by understanding the conditions of the problem. We are given a particle executing simple harmonic motion (SHM), and we are asked to demonstrate that over a period of oscillation, the average kinetic energy (KE) is equal to the average potential energy (PE). This is a typical characterization of simple harmonic motion. The mass of the particle is denoted as 'm'.\n\nStep 2) The displacement of the particle at a specific time, 't', can be represented by 'x = A sin \u03c9t'. Here, 'A' represents the amplitude of the oscillation, and '\u03c9' is the angular frequency.\n\nStep 3) To calculate the kinetic energy, we first need to find the velocity of the particle. We obtain velocity 'v' by differentiating the displacement 'x' with respect to time as 'v= dx/dt = A\u03c9cos \u03c9t'.\n\nStep 4) The instantaneous kinetic energy in terms of 'm', 'A', '\u03c9', and 't' is given by 'K = (1/2) mv\u00b2 = (1/2) m (A\u03c9cos \u03c9t)\u00b2 = (1/2) m (A\u00b2\u03c9\u00b2cos\u00b2\u03c9t)'. This equation utilizes the formula for kinetic energy, 'KE = 1/2 mv\u00b2'.\n\nStep 5) To find the average value of kinetic energy over one complete cycle, we integrate the instantaneous kinetic energy 'K' with respect to time from 0 to 'T', where 'T' is the time period. This gives us 'Kav = \u222b (1/2) m A\u00b2\u03c9\u00b2cos\u00b2\u03c9t dt over 0 to T'. After integrating, we find that 'Kav = 1/4 m A\u00b2 \u03c9\u00b2'.\n\nStep 6) Now let's move on to the potential energy. The instantaneous potential energy 'U' is given by 'U = (1/2)kx\u00b2'. Since for SHM, k = m\u03c9\u00b2, 'U' can be rewritten as 'U = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2x\u00b2 = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2A\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03c9t'.\n\nStep 7) Similar to how we found the average kinetic energy, the average potential energy over one complete cycle is given by 'Uav = \u222b (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2A\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03c9t dt over 0 to T'. After integrating, we find that 'Uav = 1/4 m \u03c9\u00b2 A\u00b2'.\n\nStep 8) Finally, we can see that the Kav and Uav obtained are identical, proving the original assertion that in simple harmonic motion, the average kinetic energy over a period is equal to the average potential energy over the same period.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin with the known conditions of this simple harmonic motion problem. We are given a particle of mass 'm'.\n\nStep 2) Express the particle's displacement at time 't' using the amplitude 'A' and angular frequency '\u03c9': 'x = A sin \u03c9t'.\n\nStep 3) The velocity 'v' is calculated by differentiating the displacement with respect to time, resulting in 'A\u03c9cos \u03c9t'.\n\nStep 4) Calculate the instantaneous kinetic energy 'K', which is equal to '1/2 m (A\u00b2\u03c9\u00b2cos\u00b2\u03c9t)'.\n\nStep 5) The average kinetic energy 'Kav' over one cycle is found by integrating the kinetic energy equation over one period from 0 to 'T', which equals '1/4 m A\u00b2 \u03c9\u00b2'.\n\nStep 6) Express the instantaneous potential energy 'U', using the displacement equation and the spring constant 'k': 'U =  (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2A\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03c9t'.\n\nStep 7) The average potential energy 'Uav' over one period is calculated by integrating the potential energy equation over time, from 0 to 'T', giving '1/4 m \u03c9\u00b2 A\u00b2'.\n\nStep 8) Observe that 'Kav' and 'Uav' are the same, confirming that in simple harmonic motion, the average kinetic energy equals the average potential energy over a period."
