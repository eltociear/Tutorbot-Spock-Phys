    "Question": "Q.6. A steel tape 1m long is correctly calibrated for a temperature of 27.0 C. The length of a steel rod measured by this tape is found to be 63.0 cm on a hot day when the temperature is 45.0 C. What is the actual length of the steel rod on that day? What is the length of the same steel rod on a day when the temperature is 27.0 C? Coefficient of linear expansion of steel = 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) K^(\u20131)",
    "Original Solution": "T = 27 C\r\nAt the temperature of 27 C, the length of the tape is 1m = 100 cm\r\nT1 = 45 C\r\nAt the temperature of 45 \u00b0C, the length of the tape is 63 cm.\r\nThe coefficient of linear expansion of steel = 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) K^\u20131\r\nLet L be the actual length of the steel rod, and L\u2019 is the length at 45 C\r\nL\u2019 = L [1 + \u221d(T1 \u2013 T)]\r\n= 100 [1+ 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) (45- 27)]\r\n= 100[1+ 21.6 \u00d7 10^(\u20135)]\r\n= 100 + 2160 x 10^(\u20135)\r\n= 100 + 0.02160 = 100.02160\r\nThe actual length of the rod at 450 C is\r\nL2 = (100.02160 /100) x 63 = 63. 013608 cm\r\nThe length of the rod at 270 C is 63.0 cm.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the problem, we are given that a steel tape of length 1m is correctly calibrated at a temperature of 27.0 C. It's important to remember that the length of objects can expand or shrink depending on the temperature, due to the property of thermal expansion. In this case, we are expressed the length in cm for ease of computation, so 1m becomes 100 cm.\n \nStep 2) The problem states that the length of a steel rod as measured by the tape on a hot day (temperature = 45.0 C) is 63.0 cm. But this measurement could be affected by the expansion of the tape due to the high temperature.\n \nStep 3) We know the coefficient of linear expansion (denoted by \u221d ) of steel is 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) K^(\u20131). This coefficient quantifies the change in length per degree change in temperature. Its an inherent property of the material, in this case, steel.\n \nStep 4) We denote L as the actual length of the steel rod, and L\u2019 as the length at the high temperature (45 C). Knowing the magnitude of thermal expansion is given by \u221d * (\u0394T), where \u0394T is the change in temperature, we form the equation L\u2019 = L [1 + \u221d(T1 \u2013 T)], where T1 = 45 C and T = 27 C.\n \nStep 5) We plug in the known values into the equation: = 100 [1+ 1.20 \u00d7 10^(\u20135) (45- 27)], which simplifies to = 100[1+ 21.6 \u00d7 10^(\u20135)]. This represents the expanded length of the tape. After calculation, we get = 100 + 0.02160 = 100.02160 cm.\n \nStep 6) The actual length of the rod at 450 C is calculated by considering the ratio of measured length to the actual length of the measuring tape: L2 = (100.02160 cm/100 cm) x 63 cm, which equals 63.013608 cm.\n \nStep 7) On a day when the temperature is 27.0 C, the tape is correctly calibrated, so the measurement of the steel rod would be correct. Thus the length of the rod would be 63.0 cm.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) We are given a steel tape calibrated at 27.0 C, with length 1m or 100 cm, and a steel rod measured as 63 cm at 45 \u00b0C.\n \nStep 2) Given the coefficient of linear expansion for steel, we can calculate the actual length of the steel tape at this higher temperature using the formula for thermal expansion: L\u2019 = L [1 + \u221d(T1 \u2013 T)].\n \nStep 3) We substitute the known values into the equation to compute the length of the steel tape at 45 \u00b0C.\n \nStep 4) Next, we find the actual length of the steel rod at 45 \u00b0C by using the proportion of the measured length to the calibrated length of the tape.\n \nStep 5) Finally, as the steel tape is calibrated at 27.0 C, the steel rod's length on a day with temperature 27.0 C would be equal to the directly measured length, which is 63.0 cm."
