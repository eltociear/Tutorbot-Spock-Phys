    "Question": "6: Toricelli\u2019s barometer used mercury. Pascal duplicated it using French wine of density 984 kg m^\u20133. Determine the height of the wine column for normal atmospheric pressure.",
    "Original Solution": "We know:\r\nDensity of mercury, \u03c11 = 13.6 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3\r\nHeight of the mercury column, h1 = 0.76 m\r\nDensity of French wine, \u03c12 = 984 kg/m^3\r\nLet the height of the French wine column = h2Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m/s^2\r\nWe know that\r\nPressure in the mercury column = Pressure in the wine column\u03c11h1 g =\u03c12h2 g\r\n h2 = \\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ \\rho _{ 1 } h_{ 1 } }{ \\rho _{ 2 } }\\end{array} = \\begin{array}{l} \\frac{ 13.6 \\times 10^{ 3 } \\times 0.76 }{ 984 } \\end{array} = 10.5 m",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Firstly, it is necessary to list all the given values in the problem for clarity. For the Toricelli\u2019s barometer that used mercury, the density is 13.6 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3 and the column height is 0.76 meters. For Pascal\u2019s barometer that used French wine, we know that the density is 984 kg/m^3 and we are asked to find the height. The acceleration due to gravity is typically at 9.8 m/s^2. Step 2) We then leverage the fact that the pressure generated by the column of liquid in each barometer is equal because they are both experiencing normal atmospheric pressure. Given this, we can equate the pressures: the pressure in the mercury column (\u03c11h1g) is equal to the pressure in the wine column (\u03c12h2g). Here, \u03c1 represents the density of the substance, h represents the height of the column, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Step 3) We then rearrange the equation for h2, which represents the height of the French wine column. That gives us h2 = \u03c11h1 / \u03c12. This equation states that the unknown height of the wine column can be calculated by multiplying the density and height of the mercury column, and then dividing by the given density of the wine. Step 4) Next, we substitute the known values into the equation. That is, we replace \u03c11 with 13.6 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3, h1 with 0.76 m, and \u03c12 with 984 kg/m^3. Solving this gives us h2 = 10.5 m. This is the expected height of the wine column under normal atmospheric pressure.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) List the known densities, heights, and gravity values for both the mercury and wine barometers. Step 2) Understand that the pressures in both columns are equal, as both are under normal atmospheric pressure, leading to \u03c11h1g = \u03c12h2g, where \u03c1 represents density, h represents height, and g is gravity. Step 3) Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown, which is the height of the wine column (h2), giving us h2 = \u03c11h1 / \u03c12. Step 4) Substitute known values into the equation for h2, which results in h2 = 10.5 meters. We now know the height of the wine column when subjected to normal atmospheric pressure."
