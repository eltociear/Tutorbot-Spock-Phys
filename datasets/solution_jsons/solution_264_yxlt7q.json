    "Question": "Q17. One end of A 20 cm long tube is closed. Find the harmonic mode of the tube that will be resonantly excited by a source of frequency 430 Hz. If both ends are open, can the same source still produce resonance in the tube? (Sound travels in air at 340 m /s).",
    "Original Solution": "Given,\r\nLength of the pipe, l = 20 cm = 0.2 m\r\nFrequency of the source = nth\r\nthe normal mode of frequency, \u03bdN = 430 Hz\r\nSpeed of sound, v = 340 ms^-1\r\nWe know that in a closed pipe, the nth normal mode of frequency vN  = ( 2n -1 )v/4l\r\nwhere n is an integer = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . .\r\n430 = ( 2n \u2013 1 )( 340/4 x0.2)\r\n2n = 2.01\r\nn \u2248 1\r\nThus, the given source resonantly excites the first mode of vibration frequency\r\nNow, for a pipe open at both ends, the nth mode of vibration frequency:\r\nVR = nv/2l\r\nn = VR 2l/v\r\nn = (2 x 0.2 x 430)/340 = 0.5\r\nAs the mode of vibration (n) has to be an integer, this source is not in resonance with the tube.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with what the problem provides us. The length of the tube, is 20 cm. But since we're working with the speed of sound, which is typically in meters per second, we convert the length to 0.2 meters. Step 2) The frequency of the sound source is given as 430 Hz. And the speed of sound in air is known at 340 m/s as provided. Step 3) We're first considering the case where one end of the tube is closed. For a closed pipe the frequency of the nth mode is calculated using vN = (2n - 1)v/4l. Here 'v' is the speed of sound, 'n' is the mode number and should be an integer, and 'l' is the length of the tube. Step 4) Substitute the given values into the equation. We get 430 = (2n - 1)(340/0.8). We can solve this equation to determine that the value of 'n' is approximately 1. So, the given sound source would resonantly excite the first mode of frequency. Step 5) Now considering if both ends of the tube are open. In such cases, the frequency for the nth mode is calculated using vR = nv/2l. Step 6) We substitute the values into the equation, which gives n = (2*0.2*430)/340, which simplifies to 0.5. However, for the equation to hold true, 'n' must be an integer. Here, it isn't. It means that when both ends of the tube are open, the same sound source cannot produce resonance.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert given length of tube from cm to m to match units of speed of sound. Step 2) Note down given values of frequency and speed of sound. Step 3) For a tube closed at one end, use the formula vN= (2n - 1)v/4l to calculate the harmonic mode that is excited. Step 4) Solve the equation with given values to determine the frequency mode excited when n\u22481. Step 5) For a tube open at both ends, we use another formula vR=nv/2l to calculate the harmonic mode. Step 6) Substitute values into the equation and solve for 'n'. As it is not an integer, the source is not in resonance with the tube when both ends are open."
