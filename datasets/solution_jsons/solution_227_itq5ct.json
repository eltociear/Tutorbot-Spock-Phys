    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's begin by acknowledging the problem's description, which we want to find the average thermal energy of a helium atom in varying temperatures. In these conditions, the temperatures are stated as room temperature (specifically 27 C), surface temperature of the Sun (given as 6000 K), and within the core of a star (a staggering 10 million or 10^7 K). Step 2) We use the formula for the average thermal energy per atom, given by (3/2)kT, where k denotes the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 m^2 kg s^-2 K^-1) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Step 3) For room temperature, we first need to convert it from Celsius to Kelvin. Recall that to translate from Celsius to Kelvin, we need to add 273 to the Celsius temperature. Therefore, 27 C = 27 + 273 = 300 K. Step 4) Now, we can substitute the room temperature (in Kelvin) and the value of the Boltzmann constant into the average thermal energy formula: (3/2)kT = (3/2) x 1.38 x 10^-23 x 300. Upon calculation, we get 6.21 x 10^-21 joules (J). As such, the average thermal energy of a helium atom at room temperature is 6.21 x 10^-21 J. Step 5) Similar calculation steps apply to the other temperatures, thermal energy for helium atom at the Sun's surface is computed as (3/2)kT = (3/2) x 1.38 x 10^-23 x 6000, yielding us with 1.241 x 10^-19 J. Meanwhile, for the helium atom in the core of a star, we pocket the calculation as (3/2)kT = (3/2) x 1.38 x 10^-23 x 10^7, squeezing out the value to be 2.07 x 10^-16 J",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the goal to find the average thermal energy for a helium atom in three different temperatures. Step 2) Use the average thermal energy formula, (3/2)kT, where k is the Boltzmann Constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^-23) and T is temperature in Kelvin. Step 3) Convert the temperatures given in Celsius (for room temperature only) to Kelvin by adding 273 to the provided Celsius measure. Step 4) Plug these temperatures (now in Kelvin) and the Boltzmann constant into the formula. For room temperature, the energy computes to approximately 6.21 x 10^-21 J, for the Sun's surface, about 1.241 x 10^-19 J, and for the star core, roughly 2.07 x 10^-16 J."
