    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given that a projectile has been fired at an angle \u03b8 w.r.t the x-axis where \u03b8 is a function of time. It indicates that the angle at which the projectile is moving changes with time. Step 2) The velocity of the projectile can be split into two components, horizontal (V0x = vx) and vertical (v0y - gt = vy). The vertical component of velocity changes with time due to gravity, and so we represent it using the equation vy = v0y - gt. Step 3) To determine the angle at any point of time, we use the tangent of the angle \u03b8(t), which is the ratio of the vertical velocity to the horizontal velocity. Therefore, tan \u03b8(t) = vy/vx = (voy \u2013 gt)/v0x. Step 4) To find \u03b8(t) itself, we take the inverse tangent of the above expression, giving us \u03b8(t) = tan -1 ((voy \u2013 gt)/v0x). Step 5) Next, let's consider the projection angle \u03b80. This relies on two parameters: the maximum height, denoted by hmax, and the horizontal range of the motion, denoted by R. We are given two equations: hmax = u^2 sin2\u03b8/2g (equation 1) and R = u^2sin2\u03b8/g (equation 2) where u is the initial speed of the projectile. Step 6) We will eliminate the common terms by dividing equation 1 by equation 2. This will result in (hmax/R) = [u^2 sin^2(\u03b8/2g)]/[ u^2 sin2\u03b8/g] = tan \u03b8/4. Solving this equation can help us find the projection angle \u03b80. Step 7) To find \u03b80 itself, we take the inverse tangent of the expression obtained in step 6, giving us \u03b80 = tan^(-1) (4 (hmax) / R).",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Acknowledge that the angle at which a projectile is launched changes with time. Step 2) Distinguish between the horizontal and vertical components of the projectile's velocity, with the vertical component affected by gravity. Step 3) Utilize the tangent function to calculate \u03b8(t) as the ratio of the vertical to the horizontal velocity. Step 4) Determine \u03b8(t) by taking the inverse tangent of the ratio from step 3. Step 5) Look at the projection angle \u03b80, which depends on the maximum height (hmax) and range (R) of the projectile's trajectory, and examine the given equations relating these quantities with the launch speed (u). Step 6) Simplify the equations for hmax and R by eliminating common terms, leading toward a formula for the tangent of projection angle \u03b80. Step 7) Solve for \u03b80 by taking the inverse tangent of the expression from step 6."
