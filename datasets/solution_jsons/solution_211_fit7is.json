    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Understanding the P-T phase diagram of CO2 requires recognizing the different regions of the graph which correspond to different phases of CO2: solid, liquid, and gas, as well as the lines that represent phase changes. It also includes points such as the triple point, where all three phases can exist in equilibrium, and the critical point, beyond which gas and liquid phases become indistinguishable. Step 2) The triple point of CO2, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist, is identified on the phase diagram at a specific temperature and pressure. In this case, the triple point occurs at -56.6\u00b0C and 5.11 atm. Step 3) The phase diagram also indicates that the fusion (melting) and boiling points of CO2 decrease as pressure decreases. This is because reducing the pressure reduces the kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to changes in phase at lower temperatures. Step 4) The critical temperature and pressure can be found, which is the point beyond which the liquid and gas phases of a substance become indistinguishable. For CO2, these are 31.1\u00b0C and 73 atm respectively. Above this temperature, and regardless of pressure, CO2 behaves as a gas due to the kinetic energy of its molecules being too high for them to be forced into a liquid state. Step 5) Finally, we can use this understanding of the phase diagram to determine the phase of CO2 at different temperatures and pressures. At -70\u00b0C and 1 atm, CO2 is a gas (below the line of sublimation). At -60\u00b0C and 10 atm, CO2 is solid (located in the solid area of the diagram). At 15\u00b0C and 56 atm, CO2 is a liquid (located in the liquid area of the diagram).",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the P-T phase diagram of CO2, including the different regions for solid, liquid, and gas phases, and the lines and points representing phase transitions. Step 2) Identify the triple point on the diagram, where all three phases coexist, in this case at -56.6\u00b0C and 5.11 atm. Step 3) Recognize that the fusion and boiling points of CO2 on the diagram reduce as pressure decreases. Step 4) Locate the critical temperature and pressure, the point beyond which liquid and gas phases become indistinguishable, here at 31.1\u00b0C and 73 atm. Above this temperature, CO2 cannot be liquefied, regardless of pressure. Step 5) Determine the phase of CO2 at given temperatures and pressures using the diagram: at -70\u00b0C and 1 atm it is a gas, at -60\u00b0C and 10 atm it is a solid, and at 15\u00b0C and 56 atm it is a liquid."
