    "Question": "Q20. Two strips of metal are riveted together at their ends by four rivets, each of diameter 6.0 mm. What is the maximum tension that can be exerted by the riveted strip if the shearing stress on the rivet is not to exceed 6.9 \u00d7 10^7 Pa? Assume that each rivet is to carry one-quarter of the load.",
    "Original Solution": "Diameter of the metal strips= 6mm = 6 x  10^-3 m\r\nRadius, r = 3 x 10^-3 m;\r\nShearing stress on the rivet= 6.9 x 10^7 Pa\r\nMaximum load or force on a rivet\r\n= Maximum stress x cross-sectional area\r\n= 6.9 x 10^7 x 3.14 x (3 x 10^-3)^2 N = 1950 N\r\nMaximum tension = 4 x 1950 N = 7800 N",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by observing that the diameter of the metal strips is given to us as 6mm. Convert this measurement to meters by multiplying it by 10^-3, as one meter is equivalent to 1000mm. This would mean the diameter is 6 x 10^-3 m. Step 2) Knowing the diameter allows us to determine the radius, which is half of the diameter. Therefore, the radius r is 3 x 10^-3 m. Step 3) We are told that the shearing stress on the rivet is 6.9 x 10^7 Pa, we don't need to convert this as it is already in the standard SI unit. Step 4) To find the maximum load or force that a single rivet can carry, we multiply the shearing stress by the cross-sectional area of the rivet. The formula for cross-sectional area of a circle is \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. We plug in the radius we found earlier to perform this calculation, yielding a force of 6.9 x 10^7 x 3.14 x (3 x 10^-3)^2 N, which is approximately to 1950 N. This is the force a single rivet can carry. Step 5) However, the problem states that each rivet carries a quarter of the load, implying the existence of four rivets. In order to find the maximum tension the strip can support, we just multiply the force per rivet by the number of rivets. So, maximum tension becomes 4 x 1950 N, which is 7800 N.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert the given diameter of the metal strips from millimeters to meters. Step 2) Derive the radius from the diameter (since the radius is half of the diameter). Step 3) Recognize that the shearing stress on the rivet is already in the appropriate units (Pa). Step 4) Calculate the maximum force each rivet can hold by multiplying the shearing stress by the rivet's cross-sectional area (using the formula for the area of a circle, \u03c0r^2). Step 5) Given that each rivet carries a quarter of the total load, multiply the force per rivet by the number of rivets to find the maximum tension the entire strip can support."
