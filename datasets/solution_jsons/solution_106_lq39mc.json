    "Question": "14. A molecule in a gas container hits a horizontal wall with speed 200 m/s and angle 30\u00b0 with the normal and rebounds with the same speed. Is momentum conserved in the collision? Is the collision elastic or inelastic?",
    "Original Solution": "Momentum is always conserved for an elastic or inelastic collision.\r\nThe molecule approaches and rebounds at the same speed of 200 m/s.\r\nu = v = 200 m s^(\u20131)\r\nTherefore, Initial kinetic energy = (1/2) mu^2 = (1/2)m(200)^2\r\nFinal kinetic energy = (1/2) mv^2 = (1/2)m(200)^2 \r\nTherefore, kinetic energy is also conserved",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin with the understanding that momentum is always conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions. This is one of the fundamental laws of physics. Step 2) The problem tells us that the molecule approaches and rebounds off the wall at the same speed of 200 m/s. We denote this speed as 'u' for the initial speed, and 'v' for the final speed after the collision. That is, u = v = 200 m s^(\u20131). Step 3) Next, we compute the initial kinetic energy. We can use the basic formula for kinetic energy, which is KE = (1/2) m u^2 where m is the mass of the object in question and u is its speed. Plugging the values we know into this equation gives us: Initial kinetic energy = (1/2) m u^2 = (1/2) m (200)^2. Step 4) We then calculate the final kinetic energy using an identical procedure. The kinetic energy formula remains the same, but we use v instead of u because this time we're calculating the kinetic energy after the collision. Therefore, Final kinetic energy = (1/2) m v^2 = (1/2) m (200)^2. Step 5) Comparing the initial and final kinetic energies, we find that they are exactly equal. This means that the kinetic energy is conserved throughout the collision.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that momentum is always conserved in all collisions. Step 2) Identify the speed 'u' before the collision and speed 'v' after the collision. Both are the same at 200 m/s. Step 3) Use the formula for kinetic energy (KE = (1/2) m u^2) to find the initial kinetic energy. Step 4) Apply the same kinetic energy formula again but with v to calculate final kinetic energy. Step 5) Recognize that the initial and final kinetic energies are equal, showing conservation of kinetic energy. That evidence implies the collision is elastic."
