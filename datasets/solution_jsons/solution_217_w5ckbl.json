    "Question": "5. In changing the state of a gas adiabatically from an equilibrium state A to another equilibrium state B, an amount of work equal to 22.3 J is done on the system. If the gas is taken from state A to B via a process in which the net heat absorbed by the system is 9.35 cal, how much is the net work done by the system in the latter case? (Take 1 cal = 4.19 J)",
    "Original Solution": "Given\r\nThe work done (W) on the system while the gas changes from state A to state B is 22.3 J\r\nThis is an adiabatic process.\r\nTherefore, change in heat is zero.\r\nSo,\r\n\u0394Q = 0\r\n\u0394W = \u2013 22.3 (Since the work is done on the system)\r\nFrom first law of thermodynamics, we have:\r\n\u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W\r\nWhere,\r\n\u0394U = Change in the internal energy of the gas\r\nHence,\r\n\u0394U = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394W\r\n= 0 \u2013 (-22.3 J)\r\nWe get,\r\n\u0394U = + 22.3 J\r\nWhen the gas goes from state A to state B via a process, the net heat absorbed by the system is:\r\n\u0394Q = 9.35 cal\r\n= 9.35 x 4.19\r\nOn calculation, we get,\r\n= 39.1765 J\r\nHeat absorbed, \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W\r\nThus,\r\n\u0394W = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394U\r\n= 39.1765 \u2013 22.3\r\nWe get,\r\n= 16.8765 J\r\nHence, 16.88 J of work is done by the system",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Identify the given information from the problem, which tells us that work (W) equal to 22.3 J was done on the system during an adiabatic process as the gas transitions from state A to B. In an adiabatic process, the change in heat (\u0394Q) is zero because there's no heat exchange with the surroundings. Hence, \u0394Q = 0. Step 2) Since work is being done on the system, it's conventionally taken as negative. Therefore, \u0394W = -22.3 J. Step 3) Apply the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy of a system (\u0394U) is equal to the sum of the heat change (\u0394Q) and work done on or by the system (\u0394W). This equation is \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W. Step 4) Rearrange the equation to solve for \u0394U, yielding the equation \u0394U = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394W. Plug the known values into the equation to find \u0394U, which is 0 - (-22.3 J). As a result, \u0394U = 22.3 J; that is, the change in internal energy of the gas is 22.3 J. Step 5) Evaluate a different process in which the gas moves from state A to B, but this time the net heat absorbed by the system is \u0394Q = 9.35 cal. Convert this amount to joules using the conversion factor 1 cal = 4.19 J. So, \u0394Q = 9.35 * 4.19 J = 39.1765 J. Step 6) Use the first law of thermodynamics again, in this alternative process. Using \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W, we can rearrange it once more for the new \u0394W by \u0394W = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394U. Substitute the known values into this equation to obtain \u0394W = 39.1765 J - 22.3 J = 16.8765 J. Hence, in the second case, the work done by the system is 16.88 J.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Find the given values and understand the nature of the process. An adiabatic process means no heat is exchanged, hence \u0394Q = 0 and work done on the system, \u0394W, is -22.3 J. Step 2) Write down the first law of thermodynamics, \u0394Q = \u0394U + \u0394W, and rearrange to find the change in internal energy, \u0394U = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394W. By substituting the known values, we find that \u0394U = 22.3 J. Step 3) Consider a different process where the gas is taken from state A to B absorbing an amount of heat, \u0394Q = 9.35 cal. Convert this to joules, resulting in \u0394Q = 39.1765 J. Step 4) With the first law of thermodynamics again, rearrange to find the new work done by the system, \u0394W = \u0394Q \u2013 \u0394U. Substituting our known values, we find that the system does 16.88 J of work in this alternative scenario."
