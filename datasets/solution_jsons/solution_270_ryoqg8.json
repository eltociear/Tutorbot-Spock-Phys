    "Question": "Q23. A narrow sound pulse (for example, a short pip by a whistle) is sent across a medium. (a) Does the pulse have a definite (i) frequency, (ii) wavelength, and (iii) speed of propagation? (b) If the pulse rate is 1 after every 20 s (that is, the whistle is blown for a split of seconds after every 20 s), is the frequency of the note produced by the whistle equal to 1/20 or 0.05 Hz?",
    "Original Solution": "(a) The speed of propagation is definite, it is equal to the speed of the sound in air. The wavelength and frequency will not be definite.\r\n(b) The frequency of the note produced by a whistle is not 1/20 = 0.05 Hz. However, 0.05 Hz is the frequency of repetition of the short pip of the whistle.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem involves understanding certain characteristics about a narrow sound pulse. Specifically, the sound pulse has a definite frequency, wavelength, and speed of propagation. Recognize that these terms are key elements of sound waves and relate to their fundamental properties. Step 2) The speed of propagation is determined by the medium through which the sound travels. In this case, the speed equals the speed of the sound in air by default. This speed is fixed and doesn't depend on the properties of the sound wave. Step 3) The frequency and wavelength of the sound, on the other hand, are not definite. They depend on the nature of the pulse signal itself, rather than the medium through which the sound travels. Recall the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of sound: Speed = Frequency x Wavelength. But here, the pulse is narrow and the duration is inconsistent, so the frequency and wavelength are not specific. Step 4) For part (b) of the problem, we need to understand the difference between the frequency of the note produced by the whistle and the frequency of repetition of the whistle sound. The pulse rate is given as 1 every 20 seconds, which means the whistle sound is produced every 20 seconds, but this does not define the frequency of the note produced. The frequency of the note is defined by the wave properties of the sound, not by the repetition rate. So, this means the frequency of the note produced by the whistle is not 0.05 Hz as one might intuitively think. Rather, the 0.05 Hz refers to the frequency of repetition of the whistle sound.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that the problem discusses the frequency, wavelength, and speed of propagation of a narrow sound pulse. These are fundamental properties of sound waves. Step 2) Understand that the speed of sound propagation is determined by the medium through which the sound travels, in this case, it is air. This speed is constant. Step 3) Realize that the frequency and the wavelength of the sound pulse are not definite because the pulse is narrow and lacks a consistent duration. Step 4) Distinguish the difference between the frequency of the note produced by the whistle and the frequency of repetition of the whistle sound. The pulse rate of 1 every 20 seconds does not mean the frequency of the note produced is 0.05 Hz, but rather it defines the rate at which the whistle is blown."
