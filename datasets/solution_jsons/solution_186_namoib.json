    "Question": "23: Two vessels have the same base area but different shapes. The first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel requires to fill up to a particular common height. Is the force exerted by the water on the base of the vessel the same in the two cases? If so, why do the vessels filled with water to that same height give different readings on a weighing scale?",
    "Original Solution": "As the base area is the same as the pressure, the force acting on the two vessels will also be the same. However, force is also exerted on the walls of the vessel, which have a nonvertical component when the walls are not perpendicular to the base. The net non-vertical component on the sides of the vessel is lesser for the second vessel than the first.  Therefore, the vessels have different weights despite having the same force on the base.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's first understand the given information. We have two vessels with the same base area, but different shapes. When they are filled up to the same height, the first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel takes. The question is whether the force exerted by the water on the base of both vessels is the same. Step 2) Remember that pressure at a point in a fluid is equal to the height of the fluid column above that point multiplied by the fluid's density and the gravitational acceleration. This means that the pressure at the bottom of both vessels is the same because the height of the water, the water's density, and gravity are the same in both vessels. Step 3) Pressure is force per unit area. Since the pressure at the base of both vessels is the same, and the area is also the same (as given), the force (which is pressure times area) must also be the same. Step 4) Now, the question also asks why there are different readings on a weighing scale when the two vessels are filled with water. While the pressure at the base of the vessel depends only on the height of the water, the weight of the water in the vessel depends on the total volume of the water, which is different in the vessels because of their different shapes. Step 5) Moreover, the force exerted by the water on the sides of the vessel is nonvertical. These forces have horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal components cancel out, while the vertical components add up to the weight of the water. The slanting shapes of the vessels mean that the second vessel has lesser vertical component forces on its sides compared to the first vessel, hence presenting different readings on the weighing scale.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize that we have two vessels with the same base area but different shapes. When filled to the same height, the first vessel takes twice the volume of water as the second. Step 2) Recall that pressure in a fluid is equal to the height of the fluid column times the fluid's density and gravitational acceleration, leading to the same pressure at the base of both vessels because they're filled to the same height. Step 3) As pressure is force per unit area and both pressure and area are the same for both vessels, the force (pressure times area) must also be equal. Step 4) The difference in weight readings on a scale occurs because the weight of the water depends on the total volume of water, which is different for each vessel. Step 5) Additionally, the force exerted by the water on the side walls of each vessel differs because of the vessels' different shapes, contributing to the difference in weight readings on the scale."
