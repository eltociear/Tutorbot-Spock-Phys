    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) From the problem, we're given the following known values: the mass of the body (m = 2 kg), the horizontal force applied (F = 7 N), and the coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bc = 0.1).  We're also told the body was initially at rest, and that we want to calculate the work done after 10 seconds (t = 10 s). Step 2) For a body under force, acceleration is given by the Net Force divided by the mass of the body (a = F/m). Here, acceleration due to the applied force (a1) is F/m = 7/2 = 3.5 m/s^2. Step 3) The opposing force, friction, is given by the formula f = \u03bcmg, where m is the mass of the object and g (\u2248 9.8 m/s^2) is the acceleration due to gravity. Calculating this, we have f = \u03bcmg = 0.1 * 2 * 9.8. Step 4) The retardation due to this frictional force (a2) is -f/m, giving us a2 = -f/m = -196/2 = -0.98 m/s^2 - an opposing force, hence the negative sign. Step 5) The net acceleration (a) of the body is the sum of these two accelerations a1 and a2; therefore it's a = a1 + a2 = 3.5 - 0.98 = 2.52 m/s^2. Step 6) The next step is to calculate the distance moved by this body during the 10 seconds. This is given by formula s = ut + (1/2)at^2. Since the body is initially at rest u=0, hence the distance is s = (1/2)*a*t^2 = (1/2)*2.52*(10)^2 = 126 m. Step 7) Work done by the applied force in 10 s (a) is given by the formula work = Force x displacement, therefore it's 7 x 126 = 882 J. Step 8) Work done by the friction (b) is given by -f x s = -1.96 x 126, negative because it's an opposing force. Step 9) Work done by the net force (c) in 10 s is W = (F \u2013 f)s = (7 \u2013 1.96) * 126 = 635 J. Step 10) From equation of motion v = u + at, final velocity v after t=10 s is v = 0 + 2.52*10 = 25.2 m/s, since body was initially at rest. Step 11) Final kinetic energy (KE_f) will be (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)*2*(25.2)^2 = 635 J. Step 12) The body was initially at rest, so initial kinetic energy (KE_i) will equal (1/2)mu^2 = 0. Step 13) The change in kinetic energy (d) is the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy, KE_f - KE_i = 635 J - 0 = 635 J. The work done by the net force is equal to the final kinetic energy.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values: mass (m), force applied (F), coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bc), and time (t). Step 2) Compute the acceleration produced by the applied force (a1) with formula a = F/m. Step 3) Calculate force of friction (f) with the formula f = \u03bcmg. Step 4) Find the negative acceleration (retardation) due to friction (a2) using a2 = -f/m. Step 5) Compute the net acceleration (a) by adding the accelerations a1 and a2. Step 6) Calculate the distance moved in 10s (s) using the formula of motion s = ut + (1/2)at^2. Step 7) Calculate the work done by the applied force using W = F*s. Step 8) Determine the work done by friction with the formula W = -f*s. Step 9) Compute the work done by the net force with W = (F - f)s. Step 10) Determine the final velocity (v) using the equation of motion v = u + at. Step 11) Calculate the final kinetic energy with KE_f = (1/2)mv^2. Step 12) Find the initial kinetic energy with KE_i = (1/2)mu^2. Step 13) Compute the change in kinetic energy as the difference between the final and initial kinetic energies. The work done by the net force equals the final kinetic energy."
