    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Recognize that the problem is about vector components. We're given unit vectors i and j, they are along the x and y axis respectively. Step 2) We have to find out what happens when we add i and j. That's the vector i + j. The premise is that the magnitude of i and j is 1, so by using the Pythagorean theorem, magnitude of i + j, will be \u221a(1^2+1^2) = \u221a2. Step 3) We display this vector in a chart, forming a right triangle with sides of unit 1. The angle \u03b8 this vector forms with the x-axis can be found using trigonometry. The answer is 45 degrees. Step 4) Now consider the vector i - j. By using the same Pythagorean theorem, we can find its magnitude which is \u221a(1^2+(-1)^2) = \u221a2. Step 5) We can also place this vector in a diagram and see that it's forming an angle of -45 degrees with the x-axis. This shows how we got different angles for different vector conditions. Step 6) The components of vector A = 2i + 3j along the directions of i + j and i - j is a bit more complex to derive. By knowing that the given vector A resolved along i + j or i - j directions will each form an angle \u03b8\u2019 with i + j, and \u03b8\u201d with i - j. To find the component of A in the direction of i + j, we find |A| cos \u03b8\u2019 along i + j, which is mathematically represented as (\u221a13 cos 11.31) * (i + j)/\u221a2 = 2.5(i + j) which equals 5/\u221a2 when simplified. Step 7) Similarly, to find the component in the direction of i - j, we find |A| cos \u03b8\u201d along i - j, which results in \u221a13 cos (90.1.31) *(i - j)/\u221a2 which gives us the value of -0.5(i - j), then simplified to -1/\u221a2. Therefore, The components of the vector A = 2i + 3j along the directions of i + j and i - j are 5/\u221a2 and -1/\u221a2 respectively.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the problem is about vector components. The given vectors are i and j along the x- and y- axis, respectively. Step 2) Determine the vector i+j and its magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem and its angle with the x-axis using trigonometry. The magnitude results in \u221a2 and the angle results in 45 degrees. Step 3) Similarly, for the vector i-j, its magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem, which results in \u221a2, and the angle it forms with the x-axis is -45 degrees. Step 4) Now, for the vector A=2i+3j, we are trying to find its components along i+j and i-j. This is done using the concept of vector resolution. Step 5) The component of A in the direction of i+j is acquired by first finding |A|cos\u03b8' along i+j, simplifying the derived equation, we get the value as 5/\u221a2.  Step 6) Similarly, the component of A in the direction of i-j is found by getting |A| cos \u03b8\u201d along i-j resulting in -1/\u221a2. Thus, the components of A in the directions of i+j and i-j are 5/\u221a2 and -1/\u221a2, respectively."
