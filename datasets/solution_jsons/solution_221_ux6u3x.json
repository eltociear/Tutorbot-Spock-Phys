    "Question": "10. A refrigerator is to maintain eatables kept inside at 9 C. If room temperature is 36 C, calculate the coefficient of performance.",
    "Original Solution": "Temperature inside the refrigerator, T1 = 9 C\r\n= 273 + 9\r\n= 282 K\r\nRoom temperature, T2 = 36 C\r\n= 273 + 36\r\n= 309 K\r\nCoefficient of performance = (T1) / (T2 \u2013 T1)\r\nOn substituting, we get,\r\n= 282 / (309 \u2013 282)\r\nWe get,\r\n= 10.44\r\nHence, the coefficient of performance of the given refrigerator is 10.44",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by noting the given problem's parameters: the inside refrigerator temperature, denoted as T1, is 9 C and the room temperature, denoted T2, is 36 C. Step 2) To prepare these values for use in calculations involving absolute scales such as the Kelvin scale, we need to convert these temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. The conversion formula is K = C + 273. Hence, we calculate T1 as 273 + 9 = 282 K and T2 as 273 + 36 = 309 K. Step 3) The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator, which is a measure of its efficiency, is calculated using the formula: Coefficient of performance = (T1) / (T2 \u2013 T1). This formula speaks to the fact that the performance depends on the temperature difference the refrigerator has to overcome to maintain the desired internal temperature. Step 4) We substitute our converted temperature values from step 2 into the coefficient of performance formula:  282 / (309 \u2013 282). Running these calculations, we find that the coefficient of performance is equal to 10.44. This means that the refrigerator is moving about 10.44 units of heat for every unit of work it is doing. Therefore, the given refrigerator has a coefficient of performance of 10.44.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the temperatures stated in the problem: T1 = 9 C (refrigerator inside) and T2 = 36 C (room). Step 2) Convert these temperatures to Kelvin to use universal standards in calculating efficiency: T1 = 282 K and T2 = 309 K. Step 3) Note that the coefficient of performance formula for a refrigerator is (T1) / (T2 \u2013 T1); this formula provides a measure of how much heat is being moved around by the refrigerator relative to the amount of work it does. Step 4) Plug in the temperature values into the coefficient of performance formula and solve resulting in a value of approximately 10.44. This indicates the refrigerator's level of efficiency."
