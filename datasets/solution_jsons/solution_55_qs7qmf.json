    "Original Solution": "(a) False\r\nIt is given that the motion of the particle is arbitrary. Therefore, the average velocity of the particle cannot be given by this equation.\r\n(b) True\r\nThe arbitrary motion of the particle can be represented by this equation.\r\n(c) False\r\nThe motion of the particle is arbitrary. The acceleration of the particle may also be non-uniform.

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start with the given problem, which asks us to test out every relation for any random or arbitrary motion in space. An arbitrary motion means that we're not setting any specific rules or parameters about how the object is moving. With this in mind, we have five relationships or equations involving velocity (v), acceleration (a), radius or displacement (r), time (t), and their average or initial values. It's clear the solution to the problem involves verifying which of these relationships hold true, irrelevant of the motion's specifics. Step 2) Let's examine the first relation (a). Here, v-average is equal to the average of the velocity at times t1 and t2. However, this assumes that the velocity is changing at a constant rate between t1 and t2, which we cannot guarantee for arbitrary motion. Thus, it's false because the motion's arbitrary nature contradicts the assumption of constant velocity change. Step 3) Next, we cross-examine relation (b). Here, v-average equals displacement (r(t2) - r(t1)) divided by the time interval (t2-t1). This is the definition of average velocity, regardless of whether the motion is constant or changing. Hence, this equation is true. Step 4) We cross-verify then relation (c), which dictates that v(t) equals the initial velocity plus acceleration times time. The issue here is similar to relation (a). It assumes that acceleration is constant, but it may not be for arbitrary motion. Hence, this equation is false. Step 5) Now, we check relation (d) which involves displacement (r(t)) equaling initial displacement plus initial velocity times time, and half of acceleration times square of time. Again, we encounter the issue of assuming constant acceleration, this equation is therefore false. Step 6) Lastly, we validate relation (e). Here, a-average equals the change in velocity (v(t2) - v(t1)) divided by the time interval (t2-t1). This is the definition of average acceleration, and it remains true regardless of whether the motion is arbitrary or not. Therefore, this equation is true.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Begin by interpreting the problem and the variables involved in the given equations. Understand that we're dealing with arbitrary motion, or motion without specific rules or patterns. Step 2) Investigate the first relation (a), which assumes a constant velocity change, contradicting the arbitrary nature of the motion in consideration, which leads us to discard it. Step 3) Examine the second relation (b), which describes the definition of average velocity, applicable to any type of motion, hence we accept it. Step 4) Scrutinize relation (c), which, similar to the first relation, assumes constant acceleration. But, in an arbitrary motion, it is unwise to assume constants, thus, we reject it. Step 5) Investigate relation (d), which, like the previous one, assumes a constant acceleration which may not be the case in arbitrary motion, hence we discard it. Step 6) Validate relation (e), which defines average acceleration, that remains true for arbitrary motion as well, thus we accept it. As a result, relations (b) and (e) remain true for arbitrary motion."
