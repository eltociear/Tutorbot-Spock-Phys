    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Begin with understanding the given values in the problem. We have two discs with moments of inertia I1 and I2 respectively. They are rotating with angular speeds \u03c91 and \u03c92 respectively. Step 2) Calculate the initial angular momenta of the individual discs. The angular momentum of a rotating object is given by the product of its moment of inertia and its angular speed. So for disc one it is L1 = I1\u03c91 and for disc two it is L2= I2\u03c92. Step 3) Sum up the individual momenta to get total initial angular momentum. Li = I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92. Step 4) When these two discs are brought together, their moments of inertia add up, and they rotate with a common angular speed \u03c9. So, the moment of inertia of the combined system (I) is I = I1 + I2. Therefore, the new total angular momentum (LT) is LT = (I1 + I2) \u03c9. Step 5) Apply the conservation of angular momentum, this principle states that the total angular momentum before the collision is equal to the total angular momentum after. So, LT = Li, which equates to I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92 = (I1 + I2)\u03c9. Step 6) Solve the equation for \u03c9 to find the angular speed of the combined system as \u03c9 = (I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92) / (I1 + I2) . Step 7) Calculate the initial kinetic energy of each disc using the formula for kinetic energy of rotating objects (K.E = 1/2 I \u03c9^2). K.E1 = 1/2 I1(\u03c91)^2 for disc one and K.E2 = 1/2 I2(\u03c92)^2 for disc two. Step 8) Sum these energies to get the total initial kinetic energy, KEI = (1/2) ( I1(\u03c91)^2 + I2(\u03c92)^2). Step 9) The final kinetic energy after the discs come together is given by KEF = 1/2 ( I1 + I2) \u03c9^2. Replace \u03c9 in this equation with the value found in Step 6. This gives: KEF = 1/2 (I1 + I2) [ (I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92) / (I1 + I2) ]^2. or, KEF = (1/2) (I1\u03c91 + I2\u03c92)^2 / (I1 + I2). Step 10) Subtract the final kinetic energy from the initial total kinetic energy: KEI \u2013 KEF. This gives the amount of energy lost during the collision. After solving the equation, this equals I1 I2 (\u03c91 \u2013 \u03c92)^2 / 2(I1 + I2), which proves to be positive. Therefore, the kinetic energy was lost, mostly due to the friction when the two turntables came in contact, as KEI > KEF.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify given values - moments of inertia (I1, I2) and angular speeds (\u03c91, \u03c92) for the two discs. Step 2) Calculate initial angular momenta (L1, L2) for each disc. Step 3) Add them together for total initial angular momentum (Li). Step 4) Observe that when discs are brought together, moments of inertia add up, the system rotates with a common angular speed (\u03c9). Calculate the new total angular momentum (LT). Step 5) Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum to equate Li and LT. Step 6) Solve for \u03c9 to find the angular speed of the combined system. Step 7) Calculate initial kinetic energy for each disc (K.E1, K.E2) using kinetic energy formula. Step 8) Sum up the individual kinetic energies for total initial kinetic energy (KEI). Step 9) Calculate final kinetic energy (KEF) for the combined system and substitute \u03c9 from step 6 into this equation. Step 10) Find difference between KEI and KEF to understand the loss of energy. Conclude that KEI > KEF shows some kinetic energy lost due to friction."
