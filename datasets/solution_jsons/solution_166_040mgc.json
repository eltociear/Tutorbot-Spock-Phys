    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start the problem by understanding the given parameters. Here, we've given the pressure at a given depth (80 atm) and the density of water at the surface (1.03 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^\u20133). To find the density of water at depth, we consider the depth as 'd', and denote the density at this depth as \u03c12.\nStep 2) We need to express the pressure at depth in a more convenient, scientific unit (Pascal). According to the conversion rate, we have: 1 atm = 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa. Thus, the given pressure, 80.0 atm, is equivalent to 80 \u00d7 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 Pa. \nStep 3) Let's denote the volume of water of mass m at the surface as V1 and at the depth 'd' as V2. Consequently, the change in volume (\u0394V) can be defined as \u0394V = V1 \u2013 V2.\nStep 4) We can express the change in volume (\u0394V) as \u0394V = m [ (1/\u03c11) \u2013 (1/\u03c12) ], where \u03c11 and \u03c12 are densities at the surface and the depth respectively.\nStep 5) By dividing \u0394V by the original volume, we can calculate the volumetric strain: Volumetric strain = \u0394V / V1 = m [ (1/\u03c11) \u2013 (1/\u03c12) ] \u00d7 (\u03c11 / m). After simplification, we get: Volumetric strain = 1 \u2013 (\u03c11/\u03c12). \nStep 6) Now we consider an important property of liquids - their Bulk modulus (B), which can be calculated using the equation: B = pV1 / \u0394V. From this equation, we can derive an expression for \u0394V / V1 as p / B, where p is pressure, B is Bulk modulus and V1 is the original volume.\nStep 7) The inverse of Bulk Modulus is known as compressibility of the material. For water, this value is 45.8 \u00d7 10^(-11) Pa^(-1). Hence, by substituting the values of pressure and compressibility into the derived expression, we can calculate \u0394V / V1= 80 \u00d7 1.01 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 45.8 \u00d7 10^-11, which comes around 3.67 \u00d7 10^-3.\nStep 8) Finally, equating the expressions for Volumetric Strain and \u0394V / V1, we can solve for \u03c12 (density at depth). By rearranging and inputting known values, we get: \u03c12 = 1.03 \u00d7 10^3 / [ 1 \u2013 3.67 \u00d7 10^-3], which gives us the final answer: \u03c12 = 1.068 \u00d7 10^3 kg m^\u20133. This is the water density at the given depth.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Interpret the given parameters density at the surface and pressure at depth.\nStep 2) Convert the given pressure from atmospheric units to Pascal.\nStep 3) Define the change in volume (\u0394V) as the difference between the volume at the surface (V1) and the volume at the depth (V2).\nStep 4) Use the formula for change in volume with respect to the masses and densities at the surface and the depth. \nStep 5) Calculate the Volumetric strain, which is a measure of volume change under pressure.\nStep 6) Recall the equation for Bulk Modulus, a measure of a substance's resistance to compression, and derive an expression for Volumetric Strain from it.\nStep 7) Calculate this Volumetric Strain by substituting the known values for pressure and compressibility of water (the inverse of Bulk Modulus).\nStep 8) Equate the two expressions for Volumetric Strain to solve for \u03c12, the density at depth, thus completing the solution."
