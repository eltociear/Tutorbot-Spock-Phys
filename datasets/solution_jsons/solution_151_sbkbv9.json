    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem provides quite a bit of information. We know that the satellite orbits the Earth at a height, h = 400 km which is 4 \u00d7 10^5 m when converted to meters for consistency. The Mass of the satellite, m = 200 kg and the Mass of the Earth, M = 6.0 \u00d7 10^24kg. The Radius of the Earth, Re = 6.4 \u00d7 10^6 m and the gravitational constant G = 6.67 \u00d7 10^(-11) N m^2 kg^(-2). We are asked to find the energy required to remove the satellite from Earth's gravitational influence.\n\nStep 2) We need to approach this problem thinking about the total energy of the satellite at its height, which is actually a sum of its kinetic and potential energy. This sum is given by the equation, E = (1/2)mv^2 -GmMe / (Re + h). Here, v is the orbital velocity of the satellite.\n\nStep 3) Before we can use this formula, we need to know the orbital velocity, v. We find this using the formula v = sqrt(GMe / (Re + h)). This equation comes from the forces acting on satellites, where gravitational force balances the force required for circular motion.\n\nStep 4) Once we have v, we plug it back into the energy formula and it simplifies to E =  -0.5*GmMe / (Re + h). The negative sign here indicates that the satellite is bound to the earth, and we call this the binding energy. \n\nStep 5) To remove a satellite from the Earth's gravitational influence, the energy required is equal to the magnitude of the binding energy, so it's E = 0.5*GmMe / (Re + h). We plug in our known values to this formula, getting E = 0.5*(6.67 \u00d7 10^(-11) N m^2 kg^(-2)) *(6.0 \u00d7 10^24kg)*(200 kg) / (6.4 \u00d7 10^6 m + 4 \u00d7 10^5 m). \n\nStep 6) Evaluating this gives us the energy required to remove the satellite from Earth's gravitational pull: E = 5.9 \u00d7 10^9 Joules.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values given in the problem: the height of the satellite's orbit, the mass of the satellite, the mass of the Earth, the radius of the Earth, and the gravitational constant. \n\nStep 2) Recognize that the total energy of the satellite at its height is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy, given by the formula E = (1/2)mv^2 -GmMe / (Re + h).\n\nStep 3) Notice that the orbital velocity (v) is unknown and needs to be calculated using the given formula for the forces acting on satellites, v = sqrt(GMe / (Re + h)).\n\nStep 4) Substitute the calculated v value into the energy formula, letting it simplify to E =  -0.5*GmMe / (Re + h). This negative value denotes the binding energy, or how much the earth is holding onto the satellite. \n\nStep 5) The energy to remove the satellite is equal to the magnitude of the binding energy. So, substitute our known values into the equation E = 0.5*GmMe / (Re + h).\n\nStep 6) Evaluate the equation to find the amount of energy required to overcome the Earth's gravitational pull, which comes out to 5.9 \u00d7 10^9 Joules."
