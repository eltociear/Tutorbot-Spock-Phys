    "Question": "8: A hydraulic automobile lift is designed to lift cars with a maximum mass of 3000 kg. The area of the cross-section of the piston carrying the load is 425 cm^2. What maximum pressure would the smaller piston have to bear?",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nMaximum mass that can be lifted, m = 3000 kg\r\nArea of cross-section of the load-carrying piston, A = 425 cm^2= 425 \u00d7 10^-4 m^2\r\nThe maximum force exerted by the load,\r\nF = mg = 3000 x 9.8 =   29400 N\r\nThe maximum pressure  on the load-carrying piston, P = F / A\r\nP = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{ 29400 }{  425 \\times 10^{ -4 }} \\end{array} \\) = 6.917 x 10^5 Pa\r\nIn a liquid, the pressure is transmitted equally in all directions. Therefore, the maximum pressure on the smaller is 6.917 \u00d7 10^5 Pa",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The first step in solving this problem is to identify the known values from the question. From the problem's statement, we know the maximum mass that the lift can carry (m) is 3000 kg and the area of the cross-section of the piston lifting the weight (A) is 425 cm^2. Step 2) We must convert the area from square centimeters to square meters, as the standard SI unit for area in physics is m^2. This can be done using the conversion factor of 1 m^2 = 10^4 cm^2, giving A = 425 \u00d7 10^-4 m^2. Step 3) We use the equation for force (F = mg), where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity, to calculate the maximum force the lift has to bear. Here, g is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. Plugging the given mass into the equation, we get F = 3000 x 9.8 = 29400 N. This step gives us the maximum force exerted by the load. Step 4) We then use the equation for pressure (P = F / A) to find out the maximum pressure on the piston. By substituting the force and area identified above, we calculate P =  29400/(425 \u00d7 10^-4)  = 6.917 x 10^5 Pa. The principle that pressure in a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions allows us to state that this will also be the maximum pressure on the smaller piston.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify known values for mass (m = 3000 kg) and cross-sectional area (A = 425 cm^2) of the piston. Step 2) Convert the area from cm^2 to m^2 because m^2 is the standard unit for area in physics. We use the conversion factor 1 m^2 = 10^4 cm^2, so A = 425 \u00d7 10^-4 m^2. Step 3) Use the equation of force (F = mg) to find the maximum force. This equation embodies the concept of weight as a force, with m as mass and g as the acceleration due to gravity (~9.8 m/s^2). This gives us F = 3000 x 9.8 = 29400 N. Step 4) Use the pressure equation (P = F / A) to compute for the maximum pressure on the piston. This equation implies that pressure is the force distributed over an area. Substituting our computed force and converted area into this equation yields the maximum pressure. Because of the principle of liquid pressure being transmitted equally in all directions, this calculated maximum pressure also applies to the smaller piston."
