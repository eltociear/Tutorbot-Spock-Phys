    "Question": "6. Two cylinders A and B of equal capacity are connected to each other via a stopcock. A contains a gas at standard temperature and pressure. B is completely evacuated. The entire system is thermally insulated. The stopcock is suddenly opened. Answer the following: \r\n(a) What is the final pressure of the gas in A and B? \r\n(b) What is the change in internal energy of the gas? \r\n(c) What is the change in the temperature of the gas? \r\n(d) Do the intermediate states of the system (before settling to the final equilibrium state) lie on its P-V-T surface?",
    "Original Solution": "(a). Now, as soon as the stop cock is opened the gas will start flowing from cylinder P to cylinder Q which is completely evacuated, and thus the volume of the gas will be doubled because both the cylinders have equal capacity.  And since the pressure is inversely proportional to volume, hence the pressure will get decreased to half of the original value.\r\nSince the initial pressure of the gas in cylinder P is 1 atm, therefore, the pressure in each of the cylinder will now be 0.5 atm.\r\n(b). Here, in this case, the internal energy of the gas will not change i.e. \u0394U = 0. It is because the internal energy can change only when the work is done by the system or on the system. Since in this case, no work is done by the gas or on the gas.\r\nTherefore, the internal energy of the gas will not change.\r\n(c) There will be no change in the temperature of the gas. It is because during the expansion of gas there is no work being done by the gas.\r\nTherefore, there will be no change in the temperature of the gas in this process.\r\n(d). The above case is the clear case of free expansion and free expansion is rapid and it cannot be controlled. The intermediate states do not satisfy the gas equation and since they are in non \u2013 equilibrium states, they do not lie on the Pressure-Volume \u2013 Temperature surface of the system",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Recognize the problem parameters. We have two cylinders A and B which have the same capacity. Cylinder A contains a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), and cylinder B is empty.\\n Step 2) When the stopcock is opened, the gas from A will immediately start moving to B. This is because cylinder B is a vacuum, and gases tend to move from areas of high pressure (cylinder A) to low pressure (the vacuum in cylinder B).\\n Step 3) Since both cylinders have the same capacity, the volume of the gas will double when it expands to fill both cylinders. This is based on the characteristics of gases, which tend to occupy all available space.\\n Step 4) Using the principle of gas laws, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume, given that temperature remains constant. When the volume doubles, the pressure will decrease to half its initial value. Hence, the final pressure of the gas in both cylinders will be half the original pressure, which is 0.5 atm.\\n Step 5) The change in internal energy is zero. The internal energy of a gas can change when work is done by the system or on the system. In this case, the gas is not performing any work to move\u2014it is simply expanding due to the pressure difference. Therefore, there is no change in internal energy (\u0394U = 0).\\n Step 6) The temperature of the gas will not change. In an ideal gas, temperature change would accompany any work done by the gas. However, in this case, the gas does not do any work during expansion; hence, there is no change in temperature.\\n Step 7) The intermediate states do not lie on the Pressure\u2013Volume\u2013Temperature (PVT) surface of the system. The process of gas moving from cylinder A to cylinder B is a rapid and uncontrolled free expansion, which leads to non-equilibrium intermediate states. These states do not satisfy the ideal gas law, hence they do not lie on the PVT surface.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand the scenario: Two equal capacity cylinders are connected; one cylinder contains gas, the other is a vacuum.\\n Step 2) On opening the stopcock, the gas flows to the vacant cylinder, thus doubling its volume.\\n Step 3) Apply the basic principle of gas laws: Pressure is inversely proportional to volume, thus the pressure halves.\\n Step 4) No physical work is done by the gas or on the gas, hence internal energy remains unchanged (\u0394U = 0).\\n Step 5) The temperature of the gas also remains unchanged as there's no work done during the expansion.\\n Step 6) The intermediate states during expansion do not lie on the Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) surface as they do not satisfy the gas laws due to the rapid, uncontrolled expansion process."
