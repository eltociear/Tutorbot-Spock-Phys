    "Question": "7. The motion of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is described by the displacement function,x(t) = A cos (\u03c9t + \u03c6 ).If the initial (t = 0) position of the particle is 1 cm and its initial velocity is \u03c9 cm/s, what are its amplitude and initial phase angle? The angular frequency of the particle is \u03c0 s^\u20131. If instead of the cosine function, we choose the sine function to describe the SHM: x = B sin (\u03c9t + \u03b1), what are the amplitude and initial phase of the particle with the above initial conditions.",

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given the displacement function x(t) = A cos (\u03c9t + \u03c6). The variables in the function represent the following: x(t) is the displacement of the particle, A is the amplitude, \u03c9 is the angular frequency (\u03c0 s^\u22121), and \u03c6 (phi) is the initial phase angle. Step 2) The initial position and velocity of the particle are stated in the problem: at time t = 0, the displacement x(0) is 1 cm and the velocity v is \u03c9 cm/s. Step 3) Substituting these initial conditions into the displacement function, we get A cos \u03d5 = 1. This equation comes from cos(0) = 1. Step 4) Next, we differentiate the displacement function with respect to time 't' to get the velocity function v = dx/dt = -A\u03c9sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6). Then, we substitute the initial conditions into the velocity equation, which yields Asin\u03d5 = -1, because sin(0) = 0. Step 5) With these two equations (Acos\u03d5 = 1 and Asin\u03d5 = -1), we square and add them. The left hand side will yield A^2, while the right hand side equals 2, yielding A = \u221a2 cm. This square root is the result of applying the Pythagorean identity sin^2 \u03c6 + cos^2 \u03c6 = 1. Step 6) Next, we divide equation Asin\u03d5 = -1 by the equation Acos\u03d5 = 1 to get tan\u03d5 = -1, hence \u03d5 = 3\u03c0/4 or 7\u03c0/4. Step 7) Now we restate the problem but now using a sine function: x(t) = B sin (\u03c9t + \u03b1) for comparison. Step 8) Applying the initial conditions to this function, we find that Bsin\u03b1 = 1. Step 9) Differentiating the sine function to find the velocity function, we find that dx/dt = B\u03c9cos(\u03c9t + \u03b1). Applying the initial conditions, we get Bcos\u03b1 = 1. Step 10) Squaring and adding the equations Bcos\u03b1 = 1 and Bsin\u03b1 = 1 gives us B^2 = 2, thus B = \u221a2 cm. Step 11) Dividing Bsin\u03b1 = 1 by Bcos\u03b1 = 1 gives us tan\u03b1 = 1, hence \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 or 5\u03c0/4",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the meaning of each variable in the given displacement function. Step 2) Understand the provided initial conditions: the displacement and the velocity at time t = 0. Step 3) Substituting these initial conditions into the displacement function to find a relationship involving A and \u03c6. Step 4) Differentiate the displacement function to get the velocity function and then substitute the initial conditions into this velocity equation to get another relationship involving A and \u03c6. Step 5) Use the equations derived in steps 3 and 4 to compute the amplitude A. Step 6) Then, use those same relationships to find the phase angle \u03c6. Step 7) Repeat steps 3 to 6 using a new function, this time a sine function. Step 8) Again, substitute the initial conditions into this new function to get a relationship involving B and \u03b1. Step 9) Differentiate this new function to get another relationship involving B and \u03b1. Step 10) Use these equations to calculate B, the amplitude with the sine function. Step 11) Finally, use the relationships to calculate the phase angle \u03b1."
