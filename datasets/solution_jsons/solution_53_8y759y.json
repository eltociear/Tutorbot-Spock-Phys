    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, recognize the given values. The initial velocity is given as 10 j m/s (which signifies that the particle is moving in the y-direction), and the acceleration is given as (8.0 i + 2.0 j) m/s^2 (which signifies that the particle is experiencing constant acceleration in both x and y-directions). Step 2) The acceleration vector is given by a = dv/dt, where 'dv' is the change in velocity and 'dt' is change in time. Substitute the given acceleration into this equation to get dv = (8.0 i + 2.0 j) dt. Step 3) Integrate both sides of this equation. The integration of the left-hand side gives the change in velocity from the initial velocity at t = 0, denoted by the velocity vector 'u'. Step 4) 'v' is velocity which can also be represented as dr/dt, where 'dr' is the change in position. Substitute for 'v' to obtain dr = (8.0t i + 2.0t j + u) dt, which indicates how the position of the particle changes over time due to its velocity and acceleration. Integrate this equation to find the coefficients for i and j, which represent the x and y coordinates of the particle at any time t. Step 5) Comparing the equations for x and y coordinates, we find that the time, t, is given by (x/4)^(1/2). Also, the y coordinate is represented as y = 10t + t^2. Substituting x = 16m into these equations, we find that the time is 2s and y = 24m. Step 6) Finally, the velocity at t = 2s is v(t) = 16 i + 14 j. The speed of the particle is the magnitude of this velocity vector, which comes out to be approximately |v| = 21.26 m/s.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the known values. The initial velocity is 10 j m/s and the constant acceleration is (8.0 i + 2.0 j) m/s^2. Step 2) Use the equation for acceleration, a = dv/dt, to write an equation for change in velocity, dv = (8.0 i + 2.0 j) dt, by simply replacing the acceleration with the given values. Step 3) Integrate this to get the change in velocity as a function of time. Step 4) Recognize that velocity 'v' can also be expressed as dr/dt, where 'dr' is the change in position. Substituting in the previous equation gets dr = (8.0t i + 2.0t j + u) dt, showing the change in position as a function of time. Integration helps find the x and y coordinates. Step 5) Compare coefficients to find expressions for time and y coordinate in terms of x coordinate, giving t = (x/4)^(1/2) and y = 10t + t^2. Substituting x=16m gives the time as 2s and y-coordinate as 24m. Step 6) To find the speed at this moment, calculate the velocity vector at t=2s as v(t) = 16 i + 14 j, and then determine its magnitude to get |v| = 21.26 m/s."
