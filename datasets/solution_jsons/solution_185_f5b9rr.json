    "Question": "21: A tank with a square base of area 1.0 m^2 is divided by a vertical partition in the middle. The bottom of the partition has a small-hinged door of area 20 cm^2. The tank is filled with water in one compartment and an acid (of relative density 1.7) in the other, both to a height of 4.0 m. Compute the force necessary to keep the door close. ",
    "Original Solution": "Given:\r\nArea of the hinged door, a = 20 cm^2= 20 \u00d7 10^-4 m\r\nBase area of the given tank, A = 2 m^2\r\nDensity of water, \u03c11 = 10^3 kg/m^3\r\nDensity of acid, \u03c12 = 1.7 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3\r\nHeight of the water column, h1 = 4 m\r\nHeight of the acid column, h2 = 4 m\r\nAcceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms^-2\r\nPressure exerted by water , P1\u00ad = h1\u03c11g  = 4 x 10^3 x 9.8  = 3.92 x 10^4 Pa\r\nthe pressure exerted by acid , P2 = h2\u03c12g  = 4 x 1.7 x 10^3 x 9.8 = 6.664 x 10^4 Pa\r\nPressure difference between the above two,\u0394P = P2 \u2013 P1\r\n= (6.664 \u2013 3.92) X 10^4= 2.744 x 10^4PaThus, the force on the door = \u0394P x a\r\n=2.744 x 10^4 x 20 \u00d7 10^(-4)= 54.88 N   Hence, the force required to keep the door closed is 54.88N.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) Let's start by understanding the information given. The area of the hinged door 'a' is stated to be 20 cm^2. However, to keep units consistent with those typically used in physics, we should convert this to m^2. This gives us 20 x 10^-4 m^2. We also know that the base area of the tank 'A' is 1.0 m^2, that the density of water '\u03c11' is 10^3 kg/m^3, the density of the acid '\u03c12' is 1.7 x 10^3 kg/m^3, and that both the water and the acid are at a height 'h' of 4 m. The acceleration due to gravity 'g' is always 9.8 ms^-2. Step 2) Once we have established these variables, we can compute the pressure exerted by both the water and the acid, using the formula for pressure P = h\u03c1g. So the pressure exerted by water or P1 = h1\u03c11g, which calculates to 4 x 10^3 x 9.8 = 3.92 x 10^4 Pa. The pressure exerted by the acid or P2 = h2\u03c12g, which calculates to 4 x 1.7 x 10^3 x 9.8 = 6.664 x 10^4 Pa. Step 3) From these, we can calculate the pressure difference between the two compartments of the tank, \u0394P = P2 - P1 = (6.664 - 3.92) X 10^4= 2.744 x 10^4Pa. Step 4) Remember that force is in a sense just 'concentrated' pressure and is calculated as the product of pressure and area. Thus, to keep the door from opening due to this pressure difference, the force exerted on the door must be exactly equal to this pressure difference times the area of the door, F = \u0394P x a. This gives us 2.744 x 10^4 x 20 x 10^-4 = 54.88N. Thus, we find that the force necessary to keep the door closed is 54.88N.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify and convert if necessary the given values into the appropriate units for the area of the door 'a', the tank area 'A', the densities of water '\u03c11' and acid '\u03c12', the heights of the water and the acid 'h', and the acceleration due to gravity 'g'. Step 2) Using the formula for pressure P = h\u03c1g, compute the pressures exerted by the water 'P1' and the acid 'P2'. Step 3) Calculating the pressure difference \u0394P between the two compartments, \u0394P = P2 - P1. Step 4) Lastly, find the force required to keep the door closed, which is equal to the pressure difference multiplied by the area of the door, F = \u0394P x a. This gives the force necessary as 54.88N."
