    "Question": "2.4 Explain this statement clearly:\r\n\u201cTo call a dimensional quantity \u2018large\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019 is meaningless without specifying a standard for comparison\u201d. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever necessary.\r\n(a) atoms are very small objects\r\n(b) a jet plane moves with great speed\r\n(c) the mass of Jupiter is very large\r\n(d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules\r\n(e) a proton is much more massive than an electron\r\n(f) the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.\r\n",
    "Original Solution": "(a) In comparison with a soccer ball, atoms are very small\r\n(b) When compared with a bicycle, a jet plane travels at high speed.\r\n(c) When compared with the mass of a cricket ball, the mass of Jupiter is very large.\r\n(d) As compared with the air inside a lunch box, the air inside the room has a large number of molecules.\r\n(e) A proton is massive when compared with an electron.\r\n(f) Like comparing the speed of a bicycle and a jet plane, the speed of light is more than the speed of sound.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem statement implies that the concepts of 'large' and 'small' are meaningless without a suitable reference point. We can't simply call something large or small in absolute terms because these terms are subjective and need something to be compared with. It is preferred to state such terms in relative meaning, comparing them with some other quantities of the same kind. Step 2) The statement (a) 'atoms are very small objects', is reframed as 'In comparison with a soccer ball, atoms are very small.' This statement adds a reference point for comparison, in this case, a soccer ball, which is understandable and relatable for most people. Step 3) Similarly, the statement (b) 'a jet plane moves with great speed', is rephrased to 'When compared to a bicycle, a jet plane moves with high speed.' By comparing the speed of a jet plane to the relatively slow speed of a bicycle, there is a clearer understanding of the 'great speed' the jet plane moves with. Step 4) The statement (c) 'the mass of Jupiter is very large', is reframed to 'When compared with the mass of a cricket ball, the mass of Jupiter is very large.' Reframing it this way includes a reference point that provides a comparison and conveys exactly how large Jupiter is. Step 5) The statement (d) 'the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules', is made more meaningful as 'As compared with the air inside a lunch box, the air inside the room has a large number of molecules.' This conveys the density and natures of air molecules. Step 6) For the statement (e) 'a proton is a lot more massive than an electron', the reformulation would be 'A proton is massive when compared to an electron.' Although there have been changes in phrasing, the comparison between a proton and an electron is maintained to emphasise the relative mass. Step 7) Lastly, statement (f) 'the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.' is restated as 'Like comparing the speed of a bicycle and a jet plane, the speed of light is more than the speed of sound.' This creates a relative comparison using the more relatable speed difference between a bicycle and a jet plane.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Recognize the need for comparative standards when determining the size, speed, mass, or any attribute of an object. Step 2) Reframe statement (a) about atoms being small by using a soccer ball as a relatable reference. Step 3) Statement (b) about jet plane's speed is reframed by comparing it to a slower-moving bicycle. Step 4) Reformulate statement (c) about Jupiter's mass by drawing a parallel with a cricket ball. Step 5) Reframe statement (d) about the number of air molecules in a room by comparing it with the air in a lunch box. Step 6) Reframe statement (e) about the mass of a proton by comparing it with an electron. Step 7) Restate statement (f) about the speed of sound and light by creating an analogy with the speed difference between a bicycle and a jet plane."
