    "Question": "13. A raindrop of radius 2 mm falls from a height of 500 m above the ground. It falls with decreasing acceleration (due to the viscous resistance of the air) until, at half its original height, it attains its maximum (terminal) speed and moves with uniform speed thereafter. What is the work done by the gravitational force on the drop in the first and second half of its journey? What is the work done by the resistive force in the entire journey if its speed on reaching the ground is 10 ms^(-1)?",

    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We are given the radius of the raindrop to be 2 mm, which we convert to metres as 2 x 10^(-3) m for consistency in units. The height from which the raindrop falls, S, is given as 500 m. We know that the density of water, \u03c1, is 10^3 kg/ m^3. With these values, we can calculate the mass of the raindrop. Step 2) To calculate the mass, we use the formula m =(4/3)\u03c0r^3 x \u03c1. Plugging in the values from step 1, we obtain m = (4/3) x (22/7) x (2 x 10^(-3))^3 x 10^3 = 3.35 x 10^(-5) kg. Step 3) Now, we calculate the gravitational force on the raindrop using the formula for force F = mg, where g is the gravitational constant 9.8 N. We find F = 3.35 x 10^(-5) x 9.8 N. Step 4) The work done by gravity on the drop in the first half of the journey is found using the formula W = mg x s. Here, s is the distance over which the force is applied, which is half the total height of the journey, or 250 m. Doing the calculation, W = 3.35 x 10^(-5) x 9.8 x 250 = 0.082 J. Step 5) For the second half of the journey, we make the key insight that since the raindrop is moving at terminal speed (constant speed), the work done by gravity will be the same as that done in the first half of the journey. Therefore, the work done by gravity in the second half of the journey also equals 0.082 J. Step 6) The total work done by the resistive force can be calculated by realizing that the total energy of the drop at the beginning of the journey must equal its total energy at the end, due to the conservation of energy. The total energy at the beginning (E1) equals the potential energy, mgh = 3.35 x 10^(-5) x 9.8 x 500 = 0.164 J. Step 7) With the final speed given as 10 ms^(-1), the kinetic energy at the end of the journey (E2 = 1/2mv^2) equals 1/2 x 3.35 x 10^(-5) kg x (10 m/s)^2 = 1.675 x 10^(-3)J. Step 8) Finally, the work done by the resistive force is the difference between the total energy at the beginning and the end, or W = E1 \u2013 E2 = 0.164 \u2013 1.675 x 10^(-3)J = 0.1623 J.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Convert the given radius to m and note down the height and the density of water. Use these values to calculate the mass of the raindrop. Step 2) Calculate the gravitational force on the raindrop using the formula F = mg. Step 3) Compute the work done by gravity in the first half of the journey using W = mg x s. Realize that the work done in the second half will be the same because the raindrop falls at a constant speed. Step 4) Understand that the total energy of the raindrop is conserved and use this to calculate the total energy at the beginning and end of the drop. Step 5) Find the work done by the resistive force by calculating the difference between the total energy at the beginning and the end of the journey."
