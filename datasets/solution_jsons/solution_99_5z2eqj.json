    "Question": "The rate of change of total momentum of a many-particle system is proportional to the external force/sum of the internal forces on the system",
    "Original Solution": "External force\r\nChange in momentum cannot be produced by internal forces, irrespective of their directions. Thus, the change in total momentum is proportional to the external force on the system.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We begin by acknowledging the context of the problem, which involves a many-particle system. A system like this has numerous particles which exert forces on each other. These are known as internal forces. The system might also experience forces from its environment, which are known as external forces. Step 2) The problem statement posits that the rate of change of total momentum of the system is proportional to the sum of the external force/sum of the internal forces on the system. This basically implies that the change in momentum (which can be calculated as final momentum minus initial momentum) relates in some way to the internal and external forces. Step 3) Our solution, however, focuses only on the external force. This might seem puzzling at first, why should we ignore the internal forces? Step 4) Here's the reason: The internal forces that particles apply on each other inside the system occur in pairs according to Newton's third law. These are also known as action-reaction force pairs. The net effect of these internal forces usually sums up to zero because the force exerted by one particle on another in the system is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the second particle on the first. Step 5) Thus, since the internal forces collectively don't bring any change in the system's total momentum, we can assert that any change in the momentum must indeed be due to the external forces. Therefore, the change in total momentum is proportional to the external force on the system. Hence, despite the apparent complexity of the many-particle system, we've realized that only the external forces truly matter in affecting the system's total momentum.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Identify the premise: the system consists of many particles experiencing both internal and external forces. Step 2) Understand the problem statement: the rate of change in total momentum of the system is said to be proportional to the sum of external and internal forces. Step 3) Shift focus solely to external forces in the solution, seemingly ignoring internal forces. Step 4) Justification for this approach: internal forces occur in pairs and tend to cancel each other out, causing no net change to the system's total momentum, per Newton's third law. Step 5) Hence conclude favoring the effect of external force: in a many-particle system under consideration, the change in total momentum is proportional to the external force applied on the system."
