    "Question": "Q11: A passenger arriving in a new town wants to go from the station to a hotel located 10 km away on a straight road from the station. A dishonest cabman takes him along a circuitous path 23 km long and reaches the hotel in 28 min.\r\n(a) What is the average speed of the taxi?\r\n(b) What is the magnitude of average velocity? Are the two equal?",
    "Original Solution": "(a) Total distance travelled = 23 km\r\nTotal time taken = 28 min = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{28}{60}\\end{array} \\) h\r\nTherefore,\r\nAverage speed = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{Total \\; distance \\; travelled}{Total \\; time \\; taken }\\end{array} \\)\r\n\r\n= \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{23}{\\frac{28}{60}}\\end{array} \\) = 49.29 km/h\r\n(b) Distance between the hotel and the station = 10 km = Displacement of the car\r\nTherefore,\r\nAverage velocity = \\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{10}{\\frac{28}{60}}\\end{array} \\) = 21.43 km/h\r\nThe two physical quantities are not equal.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) We start by focusing on what we know. The total distance travelled by the taxi is 23 km and the total time it took is 28 min. However, since speed and velocity are typically measured in km/h, we need to convert the minutes to hours. This is done by dividing 28 by 60 to get approximately 0.47 hours. Step 2) To find the average speed of the taxi, we will use the formula for speed, which states speed equals distance travelled divided by time taken. The distance travelled is 23 km and the time taken is 0.47 hours. So we divide these values to get the average speed, which comes to be approximately 49.29 km/h. Step 3) Now, let's move on to find the average velocity. The formula for velocity is similar to speed, but instead of total distance travelled, we use displacement, which is the shortest distance from the starting point to the endpoint. Even though the taxi travelled 23 km, the displacement is only 10 km because the hotel is directly 10 km away from the station. Step 4) Using this displacement and the time taken (0.47 hours), we divide 10 by 0.47 to get the average velocity, which is approximately 21.43 km/h. Step 5) Comparing the two quantities calculated, we can see that the average speed and the average velocity are not equal. The difference arises because the path taken by the car was not the shortest distance between the two points, thus making the average speed (which considers the actual path travelled) greater than the average velocity (which considers the shortest path).",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) State known values: Total distance travelled is 23 km and total time taken is 28 min, converted to 0.47 hours for calculations. Step 2) Apply the formula for average speed, which is total distance travelled divided by total time taken, to get approximately 49.29 km/h. Step 3) To find the average velocity, we consider the displacement, which is the shortest distance from the station to the hotel, which is 10 km. Step 4) Divide the displacement by the time taken, similar to how we calculated speed, to get the average velocity, totaling approximately 21.43 km/h. Step 5) Compare the calculated average speed and average velocity. They aren't equal due to the longer path travelled by the taxi, which affects the speed but not the velocity that is dependent on the direct distance between starting and ending points."
