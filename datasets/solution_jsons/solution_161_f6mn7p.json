    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) First, let's calculate the area of the cross-section of the copper piece. The cross-section is rectangular in shape and the dimensions provided are 15.2 mm \u00d7 19.1 mm. In order to keep our units consistent later when we plug values into the stress-strain equation, we need to convert these dimensions from millimeters to meters. We do this by multiplying each dimension by 10^(-3). Thus, the area of the cross-section, A, is calculated as 19.1 mm x 10^(-3) x 15.2 mm x 10^(-3) = 2.9 x 10^(-4) m^2. Step 2) From the problem, we know the force, F, exerted on the copper piece is 44,500 N. Step 3) The Modulus of Elasticity, Y, of copper (a constant that measures the stiffness of the material), is known as 42 x 10^9 Nm^(-2). Step 4) We will use the equation for the modulus of elasticity, Y = Stress / Strain, where Stress is the force per unit area (F/A). We can rearrange this equation to solve for Strain, which yields: Strain = F/(Y*A). Step 5) Now, we substitute the known values into the equation. Plugging in F = 44,500 N, A = 2.9 x 10^(-4) m^2, and Y = 42 x 10^9 Nm^(-2), we perform the calculation and find that Strain = 3.65 x 10^(-3).",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Compute the area of the rectangular cross-section of the copper piece, recalculating the dimensions from mm to m for consistency in later procedures. Step 2) Understand that the applied force on the copper piece is given as 44,500 N. Step 3) Accounting for the given modulus of elasticity for copper, which is a measure of the material's stiffness. Step 4) Apply the modulus of elasticity formula, Y = Stress / Strain, altering it to calculate Strain as Strain = F/(Y*A). Step 5) Plug in the values for Force, Area, and Modulus of Elasticity into the rearranged formula to compute the Strain."
