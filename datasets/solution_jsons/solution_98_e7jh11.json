    "Question": "Work done by a body against friction always results in a loss of its kinetic/potential energy.",
    "Original Solution": "Kinetic energy\r\nThe velocity of the body is reduced when the work done is in the direction opposite to that of friction. Thus, the kinetic energy decreases.",
    "Detailed Solution": "Step 1) The problem is stating the concept related to energy, particularly kinetic energy and work done against friction. When work is done against friction by a body, it means that energy is being used to overcome the forces of friction that tend to slow the body down or prevent it from moving. Step 2) The energy used to overcome friction decreases the body's kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of a body that it possesses due to its motion. It's given by the formula (1/2)mv^2 where m is the mass of the body and v is its velocity. Step 3) The amount of work done is directly proportional to the decrease in kinetic energy. Like if more work is done against friction, there would be a greater decrease in kinetic energy. Step 4) The energy loss due to friction is represented by the decrease in the body's velocity. This means that if the velocity of the body decreases, it means that more work has been done against friction and thus, more kinetic energy has been lost.",
    "Solution Outline": "Step 1) Understand that the problem is discussing the relationship between work done against friction and kinetic energy. Step 2) Recall that kinetic energy is the energy derived from a body\u2019s motion, decreases when work is done against friction. Step 3) Understand that the measure of work done against friction is directly proportional to the decrease in kinetic energy. Step 4) Learn that the reduction in the body's velocity is an indication of the loss of kinetic energy due to work done against friction."
